@article{bobakCorticalContrastGain1988a,
	abstract = {1. We evaluated human visual cortical contrast gain using visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements. The steady-state VEP was elicited by 7.5 Hz contrast modulation of a 6 cycles/deg sinusoidal grating. The stimulus may be regarded as the sum of a steady grating (C) and a counterphase grating of the same spatial frequency (delta C). The counterphase grating is modulated sinusoidally in time. 2. The VEP was measured to combinations of different modulation contrasts (delta C) and different mean levels of grating contrast (C) which produced stimuli with contrast modulation depths (delta C/C) ranging from 0.0625 to 1.0 (`on-off'). 3. The VEP signals were Fourier analysed and the amplitude and phase of the first (7.5 Hz) and second (15 Hz) harmonic frequency components were examined. The monocular VEP to a contrast-modulated grating contains significant first and second harmonic frequency components. 4. The amplitude and phase of the monocular VEP was plotted as a function of delta C for each mean level of contrast explored. The amplitudes of both the first and second harmonic frequency components grow with increasing delta C. However, the slope of each function depends on the mean contrast (C): with higher levels of C, the slope of the function is more shallow. Furthermore, at each level of C the amplitude of the first harmonic frequency saturates at a lower delta C than does the second harmonic frequency component. VEP amplitude is therefore not determined by the absolute contrast change (delta C) alone. The VEP phase of the first harmonic frequency shows less dependence on either modulation or on mean contrast; the phase of the second harmonic frequency component is strongly dependent on mean contrast (C) but not on delta C. 5. When the second harmonic amplitude component of the VEP response (R) is expressed as Ractual/Rmax, where Rmax is the response to C = delta C (i.e. `on-off'), all second harmonic VEP functions can be well fitted with a power function. This is not the case for the function of the first harmonic amplitude data. 6. A dichoptic VEP was obtained by presenting the steady and counterphase gratings to opposite eyes. The dichoptic VEP, in distinction to the monocular VEP, contains only a second harmonic frequency component. The amplitude of the second harmonic frequency component grows with increasing delta C, similar to the function seen for the monocular VEP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{morganSelectiveAttentionStimulus1996,
	abstract = {Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from the scalp of human subjects who were cued to attend to a rapid sequence of alphanumeric characters presented to one visual half-field while ignoring a concurrent sequence of characters in the opposite half-field. These two-character sequences were each superimposed upon a small square background that was flickered at a rate of 8.6 Hz in one half-field and 12 Hz in the other half-field. The amplitude of the frequency-coded SSVEP elicited by either of the task-irrelevant flickering backgrounds was significantly enlarged when attention was focused upon the character sequence at the same location. This amplitude enhancement with attention was most prominent over occipital-temporal scalp areas of the right cerebral hemisphere regardless of the visual field of stimulation. These findings indicate that the SSVEP reflects an enhancement of neural responses to all stimuli that fall within the "spotlight" of spatial attention, whether or not the stimuli are task-relevant. Recordings of the SSVEP provide a new approach for studying the neural mechanisms and functional properties of selective attention to multi-element visual displays.},

@article{norciaSpatialFrequencySweep1985c,
	abstract = {The grating acuity of 197 infants from 1 week to 53 weeks of age was measured using the visual evoked potential (VEP) in response to counterphase grating stimulation. The gratings were presented as a 10 sec spatial frequency sweep which spanned the acuity limit. The amplitude and phase of the second harmonic response were extracted by discrete Fourier analysis. The VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function showed narrow spatial frequency tuning with amplitude peaks at one or more spatial frequencies. The phase of the response at medium to high spatial frequencies was generally constant at a spatial frequency peak, followed by a progressive phase lag with increasing spatial frequency. Grating acuity was estimated by linear extrapolation to zero microvolts of the highest spatial frequency peak in the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function. This visual acuity estimate increased from a mean of 4.5 c/deg during the first month to about 20 c/deg at 8-13 months of age. The VEP acuities at 1 month are a factor of three to five higher than previously reported for pattern reversal or pattern appearance stimuli. By 8 months VEP grating resolution was not reliably different from adult levels in the same apparatus.},

@article{ohzawaContrastGainControl1985,
	abstract = {We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the process. In another series of experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3\% was capable of nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges could be elicited directly (the central discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable variability in this value from cell to cell.},

	abstract = {We have characterized the contrast-response relationships for simple and complex cells in striate cortex of macaque monkey, before and during adaptation to high-contrast sinusoidal gratings of the optimal spatial-frequency and orientation. Adaptation brings about systematic changes in the steepness of contrast-response curves and in the effective contrast of stimuli. Adaptation reduces the detectability of low-contrast gratings by almost a factor of three, but by extending the operating range of most cells it appears to improve the discriminability of high-contrast stimuli that previously gave rise to responses of saturating amplitude.},

@article{reganEvokedPotentialPsychophysical1970,
	abstract = {The intensities of two superposed beams of different colours were sinusoidally modulated at frequencies near 16 c/sec so as to generate an alternating-wavelength stimulus, and used in a joint psychophysical and evoked potential (EP) investigation. The relative phases and modulation depths of the two beams were varied and the conditions for minimum EP amplitude compared with the conditions for minimum (or zero) subjective flicker. When the relative modulation depths of the beams were varied, the fundamental EP gave (a) no minimum, of (b) a minimum displaced from the subjective minimum of (c) rarely, a minimum coincident with the subjective minimum. This depended on the subject and the electrode position. Cases (a) and (b) could be explained by the findings that(1) the relative phases of the beams for minimum subjective flicker differed considerably (50{$^\circ$}--110{$^\circ$}) from the relative phases for minimum EP, and(2) the relation between the amplitude of the fundamental component of the EP and stimulus modulation depth was different for different colours. Minimum subjective flicker seems to be related to stimulus intensity, and modulation depth in a different way than is minimum amplitude of the fundamental component of the EP, so that whether the subject sees flicker has no correlation with the minimum in the fundamental EP.

On varie les phases relatives et les profondeurs de modulation des deux faisceaux, et les conditions de l'amplitude minimale de EP sont compar{\'e}es{\`a}celle du papillotement subjectif minimal (ou nul). Quand on modifie les profondeurs de modulation relative des faisceaux, le EP fondamental pr{\'e}sente (a) soit aucun minimum, (b) soit un minimum d{\'e}plac{\'e}par rapport au minimum subjectif, (c) soit rarement un minimum qui co{\"\i}ncide avec le minimum subjectif. Cela d{\'e}pend du sujet et de la position de l'{\'e}lectrode. On peut expliquer les cas (a) et (b){\`a}partir des r{\'e}sultats suivants:(1) les phases relatives des faisceaux pour le papillotement subjectif minimal diff{\`e}rent consid{\'e}rablement (de 50{\`a}110{$^\circ$}) des phases relatives du EP minimal, et(2) la relation entre l'amplitude de la composante fondamentale de EP et la profondeur de modulation du stimulus diff{\`e}re pour les diverses couleurs. Le papillotement subjectif minimal semble d{\'e}pendre de l'intensit{\'e}du stimulus et de la profondeur de modulation d'une fa{\c c}on diff{\'e}rente de l'amplitude minimale de la composante fondamentale de EP. si bien que le fait que le sujet per{\c c}oit un papillotement n'a pas de corr{\'e}lation avec le minimum du EP fondamental. Die Intensit{\"a}ten zweier verschieden f{\"a}rbiger, einander{\"u}berlagerten Lichtstr{\"a}hle wurden sinusm{\"a}ssig bei einer Frequenz von ungef{\"a}hr 16 Hz moduliert, um einen Wechselschwellenreiz zu erzeugen: sie wurden in einer gemeinsamen Untersuchung mit psychophysischen Methoden und evozierten Potentialen (EP ben{\"u}tzt.

	abstract = {We have monitored the development of infant colour vision by measuring chromatic contrast sensitivity and acuity in eight young infants over a period of 6 months. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPS) were recorded in response to both chromatic (red---green) and luminance (red---black or green---black) patterns that were reversed in contrast over time. For most infants, no response could be obtained to chromatic stimuli of any size or contrast before 5 weeks of age, although luminance stimuli of 20\% contrast gave reliable responses at that age. When responses to chromatic stimuli first appeared, they could be obtained only with stimuli of very low spatial frequency, 20 times lower than the acuity for luminance stimuli. Both contrast sensitivity and acuity for chromatic stimuli increased steadily, more rapidly than for luminance stimuli. As the spectral selectivities of infant cones are similar to those of adults, the difference in rate of development of luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity and acuity stimuli probably reflects neural development of the infant colour system.},

	abstract = {We have monitored the development of contrast sensitivity to equiluminant red-green chromatic patterns by monitoring visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in 13 infants. The results confirm our previous report [Morrone, Burr and Fiorentini, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 242 (1990a)] that, before 7--8 weeks of age, there was no response to purely chromatic stimuli, while at the same age Iuminance stimuli of 20\% contrast produced reliable responses. At all ages (even before the onset of a chromatic response) the colour mixture to yield equiluminance was similar to that of adults, suggesting that the relative proportion and efficacy of medium- and long-wave cones is similar for infants as for adults. For both luminance and chromatic stimuli, amplitude increased roughly linearly with log-contrast, so sensitivity thresholds could be predicted by linear extrapolation to the abscissa. Detailed contrast sensitivity curves were measured for four infants at various ages. The results show that luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity develop independently at different rates, probably reflecting differential development of postreceptoral neural mechanisms.},

@article{brownDevelopmentVisualSensitivity1990a,
	abstract = {The recent literature on test threshold and color vision in human infants is critically reviewed. Test thresholds are higher in infants than in adults at the absolute threshold and at all adapting luminances, but approach adult values rapidly over the first six months of life. The spectral luminous efficiency function of infants is similar to V ({$\lambda$}) above 1.0 log phot, cd/m2. For lights below about 1.0 log scot, cd/m2 and wavelengths shorter than 590 nm, the luminous efficiency function is simlar to V{$\prime$}({$\lambda$}). The luminous efficiency of any given stimulus may differ markedly between infants and adults, especially when the adult data depend on the temporal and spatial parameters of the stimuli. Color vision improves greatly over the first three postnatal months, and most normal 3-month olds have at least some color vision. The overall insenstivity of infants to contrast is likely to provide a satisfactory explanation of the poor color vision of infants. The critical immaturity primarily responsible for the high thresholds and poor color vision of infants is probably after the site of visual adaptation, although lower-level factors may also play a role.},

	abstract = {The electrophysiology of normal binocular function was investigated by studying the binocular interactions from monocular and binocular visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded under a range of stimulus conditions. The amplitude and phase of the steady-state VEPs, which were obtained with sinusoidal gratings temporally modulated in counterphase, were measured with synchronous narrow-band filtering techniques. Binocular interactions were investigated as functions of spatial frequency, temporal frequency and contrast. Detailed sampling and testing within each stimulus domain revealed an unprecedented degree of VEP specificity in the extent of binocular interaction, which varied from zero summation to pronounced facilitation. Binocular facilitation was explored in terms of its relation to the neural mechanisms subserving binocular function. VEP correlates of rivalry, fusion and stereopsis were obtained. The facilitatory binocular interactions, revealed by careful spatial and temporal stimulus manipulations, were akin more to the neurophysiological responses of single neurons than to previously reported evoked potential work. The relationship between the specificity and narrow tuning of the binocular interactions recorded with VEP techniques and those recorded with single unit techniques is discussed.},

@article{brownDevelopmentRivalryDichoptic1999,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the development of rivalry, dichoptic masking, and binocular interactions in infants more than 5 months of age using the visual evoked potential (VEP). METHODS: VEPs were recorded in 35 infants between 5 and 15 months of age and 23 adults between 13 and 59 years of age. Counterphasing, sinusoidal, 1 cycle/deg gratings were presented dichoptically. Responses from each eye were isolated by "tagging" each half-image with a different temporal frequency (5 or 7.5 Hz). Observers were presented with fixed 80\% contrast gratings in each eye in experiment 1. Rivalry was detected on the basis of a negative correlation between the simultaneously measured response amplitudes at the second harmonics of the two eye-tagging frequencies. In a second analysis of the same data, response amplitudes recorded under dichoptic viewing conditions were compared to those obtained in a monocular control condition (dichoptic masking). In experiment 2, a 40\% fixed-contrast grating was presented to one eye, whereas the other eye viewed a grating that was swept in contrast from 1\% to 67\%. Dichoptic masking was measured as the reduction in the fixed-grating response caused by the variable contrast grating. RESULTS: Experiment 1: although adults showed evidence of VEP amplitude alternations between the eyes for cross-oriented half-images (physiological rivalry), infants did not. This immature response to rivalrous stimuli occurred despite the presence of responses at nonlinear combination frequencies recorded with gratings of the same orientation in each eye, a definitive indication of binocular interaction. In addition, both iso- and cross-oriented half-images produced less dichoptic masking in infants than in adults in this experiment. Experiment 2: dichoptic masking in the infants was equivalent to that seen in adults with parallel gratings in the two eyes; however, masking with cross-oriented configurations was approximately five times weaker in the infants relative to the adults. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have identified a set of stimulus conditions under which infants between 5 and 15 months of age fail to demonstrate physiological rivalry despite the presence of binocular interactions. The observed lack of binocular rivalry may be the result of a specific immaturity in dichoptic, cross-orientation suppression.},

Over a wide range of spatial frequencies the contrast threshold of a grating is determined only by the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier component of its wave form. 4. Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sine-wave gratings until their contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their independent threshold. 5.

Extrapolation to zero amplitude voltage of the regression line between the amplitude of the evoked potential and log. contrast predicts the psychophysical threshold.

Below 3 c/deg the results are best fitted with two regression lines; one of these is generated from the foveal and the other from the parafoveal representation in the cortex.5. The slope of the regression lines was found to be almost independent of either the spatial frequency or the area of the stimulus grating.6. The slope of the regression lines could be markedly increased by using as a stimulus either two different spatial frequencies, or two different orientations, presented simultaneously.7. Using the evoked potential the selectivity to orientation was found to be so high that a channel was not influenced by another orientation 15 degrees away.8. The channels selectively sensitive to spatial frequency were highly selective and were not influenced by another spatial frequency one octave removed in spatial frequency.9. It is concluded that in man there exist neurones highly selective to both orientation and spatial frequency.},

Here the development of orientation processing is further examined using a visual-evoked potential paradigm and normalization models of pattern masking. Contrast response functions were measured for 1 cycle per degree (cpd) gratings, counterphase-reversed in contrast at either 3.3 or 5.5 Hz. A second 1 cpd, 20\% contrast, 8.3 Hz grating of either the same or orthogonal orientation was added as a mask. Evoked responses associated with the test grating, the mask, and intermodulation between the two were individually extracted using spectral analysis of the scalp-recorded EEG. Adults exhibited orientation selectivity in the masking of their test component responses and in nonlinear intermodulation between the test and mask stimuli. Infants {$<$}5 months old, however, demonstrated nonselective masking or a reversed selectivity in their responses to the test component, with adult-like orientation selectivity in their intermodulation responses. Within the context of a normalization model of pattern masking, the results are consistent with the existence of oriented filters early in life the responses of which are normalized immaturely until {$\sim$}5 months of age.},

We further developed the quick method to measure directly the points of the Volterra kernels which are located along one or more axes in the frequency domain, thus making our method complete and more accurate than that presented in Reference 1.

Retinal and cortical long-term contrast adaptation was assessed with simultaneous measurement of pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and cortical visual evoked potentials (VEPs). This study involved three approaches: sampling of the contrast transfer function from 2.7\% to 98\% with adaptation to high (98\%) and low (7.3\%) contrasts, linearity of adaptation effects, and transfer of contrast adaptation between parallel and orthogonal grating orientations.  results. Contrast adaptation affected retinal and cortical recordings quite differently. The VEP showed a sigmoid contrast transfer function, which was shifted toward higher contrasts (by a factor of 1.9), whereas amplitudes at higher test contrasts were enhanced to 127\%. The PERG decreased in amplitude to approximately 90\%, and the latency was significantly reduced by 4 to 6 msec (P \&lt; 0.05). All measured effects were linear with adaptation contrast. Orientation played no role in the PERG results, whereas the VEP was enhanced to 125\% when tested parallel and to 150\% when tested orthogonal to adaptation.  conclusions. VEP results confirm and extend previous findings and fit well with single-cell recordings.

(2) The SSVEP can also show narrow temporal frequency tuning, as narrow as 0.5 octave at half height. (3) Contrast functions relating VEP amplitude to log contrast were highly nonlinear.

VEP CRFs in infants were found to have a form similar to those observed in adults, being linear functions of log contrast over a range of near-threshold contrasts. CRFs with low and high contrast lobes were present in infants, as they are in adults. Contrast thresholds were estimated by extrapolation of the CRF to zero microvolts. The effects of additive EEG noise and of the DFT data window on the shape of the measured CRF are considered. For large signals, the measured CRF is nearly independent of the additive noise, but at small signal values additive noise introduces a small bias towards larger amplitudes. The VEP signal-plus-noise distribution was modeled as a family of Rice distributions in order to evaluate the effects of bias on the estimates of threshold. The amount of bias depends inversely upon the slope of the CRF. The amount of bias introduced by a smoothing window also depends upon slope of the CRF as well as the sweep rate. The combined effects of additive noise and window bias were such that the total bias was nearly independent of CRF slope. Sweep VEP contrast thresholds were shown empirically to be unaffected by changes in the range of contrast swept.},

	abstract = {Contrast response functions (CRFs) for the VEP were obtained with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) technique employing swept contrast gratings. VEP CRFs in infants were found to have a form similar to those observed in adults, being linear functions of log contrast over a range of nearthreshold contrasts. CRFs with low and high contrast lobes were present in infants, as they are in adults. Contrast thresholds were estimated by extrapolation of the CRF to zero microvolts. The effects of additive EEG noise and of the DFT data window on the shape of the measured CRF are considered. For large signals, the measured CRF is nearly independent of the additive noise, but at small signal values additive noise introduces a small bias towards larger amplitudes. The VEP signal-plus-noise distribution was modeled as a family of Rice distributions in order to evaluate the effects of bias on the estimates of threshold. The amount of bias depends inversely upon the slope of the CRF. The amount of bias introduced by a smoothing window also depends upon slope of the CRF as well as the sweep rate. The combined effects of additive noise and window bias were such that the total bias was nearly independent of CRF slope. Sweep VEP contrast thresholds were shown empirically to be unaffected by changes in the range of contrast swept.},

@article{norciaSpatialFrequencySweep1985b,
	abstract = {The grating acuity of 197 infants from 1 week to 53 weeks of age was measured using the visual evoked potential (VEP) in response to counterphase grating stimulation. The gratings were presented as a 10 sec spatial frequency sweep which spanned the acuity limit. The amplitude and phase of the second harmonic response were extracted by discrete Fourier analysis. The VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function showed narrow spatial frequency tuning with amplitude peaks at one or more spatial frequencies. The phase of the response at medium to high spatial frequencies was generally constant at a spatial frequency peak, followed by a progressive phase lag with increasing spatial frequency. Grating acuity was estimated by linear extrapolation to zero microvolts of the highest spatial frequency peak in the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function. This visual acuity estimate increased from a mean of 4.5 c/deg during the first month to about 20 c/deg at 8-13 months of age. The VEP acuities at 1 month are a factor of three to five higher than previously reported for pattern reversal or pattern appearance stimuli. By 8 months VEP grating resolution was not reliably different from adult levels in the same apparatus.},

	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence from electrophysiological studies that low-level visual processing is atypical in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Abnormalities in early stages of sensory processing are of interest because they could lead to downstream functional deficits in social or cognitive domains. Using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), we studied how well spatial information is transmitted over a wide range of spatial frequencies (2--30 cycles/deg), including those at the limit of visibility (visual acuity). SSVEPs were recorded over 128 channels in 16 ASD participants between 5 and 17 years old and 17 age-matched, neurotypical (NT) participants. We observed a selective reduction of the amplitude of the SSVEP second harmonic pattern reversal response between 5 and 17 cycles/deg. Responses measured at the fourth harmonic were normal at all spatial frequencies tested, as were responses at the lowest and highest spatial frequencies at the second harmonic. The reduction of second harmonic responses occurred preferentially over right occipital electrodes. Because response abnormalities are restricted to a specific response harmonic and to specific ranges of spatial frequency, we can rule out nonspecific differences between the ASD participants and the NT controls. This particular pattern of loss, combined with the observed exaggeration of the loss over the right hemisphere, suggests that a highly specific neural substrate early in the visual pathway is compromised in ASD.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological responses in human index an interaction between responses to two gratings that is relatively independent of the distribution of light in the retinal image. Two 5 cycle/deg sinewave gratings were superimposed, one counterphase-modulated at F1 Hz and the other at F2 Hz. Nonlinear interaction terms of frequency (nF1 +/- mF2) were recorded that could not be produced by superimposing the F1 Hz grating on blank-field 7 Hz flicker. A local luminance origin could be excluded for the (2F1 + 2F2) term and for the suppression of 2F1 and 4F1, but not for the (F1 + F2), (F1 + 3F2) and (5F2 - F1) terms. The relative spatial phase of the two gratings was varied, thus altering the light distribution in the retinal image without changing its spatial power spectrum. The (2F1 + 2F2) Hz contrast-specific grating-grating interaction term was almost unaffected by these substantial changes in retinal image light distribution providing that the spatial frequency power spectrum of the retinal image was held constant. The (2F1 + 2F2) term and the suppression of 2F1 were both tuned to spatial frequency.},

	abstract = {With no prior information of either spherical or cylindrical components, objective (evoked potential) refraction can be performed up to 100 times faster than by comparable averaging procedures. The new procedure is to directly obtain the required graph of evoked potential (EP) amplitude vs. some stimulus parameter rather than to make separate measurements of each point on the graph. Fourier-analyzed EP's provide the clinician with an immediate indication of the result of altering refractive correction, so that this EP procedure is analogous to conventional subjective refraction. While the subject views the pattern through a rotating stenopeic slit, a 10-second plot of EP amplitude vs. slit angle can indicate the axes of astigmatism to within 10{$^\circ$}. The slit is then set parallel first to one axis of astigmatism and is then turned through 90{$^\circ$} while the subject views the pattern through a lens whose power is continuously oscillated. Each of these two graphs of EP ajnplitude vs. lens power can be obtained in 10 to 20 seconds; these data give a complete description of the required refractive correction to within 0.5 D. The use of checks rather than stripes gives a faster procedure.},

@article{rossContrastAdaptationContrast1997,
	abstract = {After a preliminary study of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to a test grating seen in the presence of masks at different orientations, psychophysical data are presented showing the effects of adaptation and of masking on thresholds for detecting the same test grating. The test is a vertical grating of spatial frequency 2 cycles per degree; adapting and masking gratings differ from the test either in orientation or in spatial frequency. The effects of adaptation and masking are explained by a single mechanism model that assumes: (i) adaptation and masking both alter the contrast response (or transducer) function of the mechanism that detects the test; (ii) masks, but not adaptors, stimulate the mechanism that detects the test; and (iii) a test is detectable when it raises response level by a constant amount. The model incorporates two distinct tuning functions, a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. It accounts adequately for all the data, including the location and size of the facilitative dip found in some masking functions, the constant slopes of the threshold elevation segments of adaptation functions and the varying slopes of masking functions. It also predicts the sometimes surprising joint effects of adaptation followed by masking and of two masks operating simultaneously.},

The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems.

@article{skoczenskiDevelopmentVEPVernier1999,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the developmental sequences of two basic measures of pattern vision, Vernier acuity and grating acuity, using steady state visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and an analysis designed to isolate pattern-specific responses from those due to motion in the Vernier stimulus. METHODS: The authors recorded VEPs from 57 healthy full-term infants and 4 adults. The grating acuity stimulus was a sinusoidal grating, temporally modulated (appearance-disappearance) at a rate of 3 Hz, with spatial frequency decreasing in linear steps during each 10-second trial. The Vernier acuity stimulus was a vertical square-wave grating with portions of each bar temporally modulated to make offsets appear and disappear at a rate of 3 Hz. Vernier offset size changed in log steps from small to large offsets. The authors recorded each observer's electroencephalogram (EEG) during multiple presentations of each stimulus type, and the EEG was digitized and filtered to obtain the amplitude and phase of the response at the first two harmonics of the stimulus temporal frequency. Thresholds were estimated with an extrapolation technique that took into account the signal-to-noise ratio and phase of the response. RESULTS: VEP Vernier acuity and grating acuity develop at different rates, with grating acuity approaching adult levels earlier than Vernier acuity. The within-subject relationship between VEP Vernier acuity and grating acuity follows the same developmental trajectory established by previous psychophysical studies of humans and monkeys. CONCLUSIONS: This VEP technique provides a rapid estimate of Vernier acuity in infants. VEP Vernier acuity remains strikingly immature throughout the first year of life, similar to behavioral Vernier acuity. Because Vernier acuity is a sensitive measure of amblyopia, this VEP test may be useful in the future to identify amblyopia and to follow its treatment progress in pediatric patients.},

@article{skoczenskiNeuralNoiseLimitations1998,
	abstract = {Visual contrast sensitivity is poor in newborn human infants, but improves rapidly to approach adult levels by 8 months of age. During this period, infant sensitivity can be limited by physical factors affecting photon capture, such as eye size and photoreceptor density. Here we show that infant visual sensitivity is also limited by high levels of noise in the neural transduction process. Using a non-invasive electrophysiological measurement and a visual noise titration technique, we have found that intrinsic neural noise in neonates is approximately nine times higher than in adults. As intrinsic neural noise decreases during infancy, contrast sensitivity improves proportionally, suggesting that neural noise places critical limits on contrast sensitivity throughout development. Moreover, contrast gain control, an inhibitory process that adjusts visual responses to changing stimulation, is in place and operating in infants as young as 6 weeks of age, in spite of high levels of neural noise and significant immaturities in contrast sensitivity. The contrast gain control that we observed in human neonates may serve as a building block for more complex forms of visual inhibition, which develop later in infancy.},

@article{reganEvokedPotentialsSpecific1973,
	abstract = {The human brain generated electrical responses (EPs) to changes in the chromatic contrast of an equiluminant spatially-patterned stimulus even when the eye's longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberrations were simultaneously cancelled. Pattern EPs were strongly affected by ocular chromatic aberration. EP and subjective estimates of longitudinal chromatic aberration agreed closely. Psychophysical contrast threshold correlated with the amplitudes of EPs elicited both by monochromatic patterns of checks and by equiluminant patterns of alternately-coloured checks or bars. Restricting stimulation to the fovea may enhance the effect of intersubject variations of neuroanatomy upon EPs. Physiological signals seem to be segregated into colour channels until the first responses to contrast. The EP data suggest that there is an antagonistically-organized chromati-contrast channel in parallel with colour-coded luminance-contrast channels. EP results suggest that the human visual system handles colour information differently when colour is linked with spatial form than when colour is not linked with form.

Bright or dark checks were used to drive ON or OFF pathways, and low or high-contrast conditions were used to emphasize activity from magnocellular or parvocellular pathways. Manipulation of stimulus parameters and frequency analysis of the VEP were performed to obtain spatial and contrast--response functions. A biophysical explanation is offered for why the opposite polarity stimuli drive selectively ON and OFF pathways in primary visual cortex, and a lumped biophysical model is proposed to quantify the data and characterize changes in the dynamics of the system with contrast given a limited number of parameters. Response functions were found to match the characteristics of the targeted pathways.},

@article{KaestnerTVST2024,
	abstract = { Our goal is to describe the contrast and blur sensitivity of
multiple horizontal disparity subsystems and to relate them to the contrast and
spatial sensitivities of their monocular inputs. Steady-state visual evoked
potential (SSVEP) amplitudes were recorded in response to dynamic random
dot stereograms (DRDSs) alternating at 2 Hz between zero disparity and
varying magnitudes of crossed disparity for disparity plane and disparity
grating stimuli. Half-image contrasts ranged between 2.5\% and 80\% and over
a range of Gaussian blurs from 1.4 to 12 arcmin. Separate experiments
measured contrast and blur sensitivity for the monocular half-images. The
first and second harmonics disparity responses were maximal for disparity
gratings and for the disparity plane condition, respectively. The first harmonic
of the disparity grating response was more affected by both contrast and blur
than was the second harmonic of the disparity plane response, which had
higher contrast sensitivity than the first harmonic. The corrugation frequency,
contrast, and blur tuning of the first harmonic suggest that it reflects activity of
neurons tuned to higher luminance spatial frequencies that are selective for
relative disparity, whereas the second harmonic reflects the activity of neurons
sensitive to absolute disparity that are driven by low monocular spatial
frequencies. SSVEPs to DRDSs provide two objective neural measures of
disparity processing, the first harmonic{\^a}€''whose stimulus preferences are
similar to those of behavioral stereoacuity{\^a}€''and the second harmonic that
represents an independent disparity-specific but not necessarily stereoscopic
mechanism. },

was examined in nine observers. A 6.0 cycles/deg (cpd) grating was modulated

second harmonic components: their growth with contrast is parallel, each
function consisting of two limbs. The data are consistent with the hypothesis
that the pattern VEP obtained with "on-off" presentation may reflect the
contributions of "low" and "high" contrast neuronal populations demonstrated

	abstract = {Neuromodulation of deep brain structures via transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising, but still elusive approach to non-invasive treatment of brain disorders. The purpose of this study was to confirm that MR-guided TUS of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) can modulate visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the intact large animal; and to study the impact on cortical brain oscillations. The LGN on one side was identified with T2-weighted MRI in sheep (all male, n = 9). MR acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) was used to confirm localization of the targeted area in the brain. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded, and the visual evoked potential (VEP) peak-to-peak amplitude (N70 and P100) was calculated for each trial. Time-frequency spectral analysis was performed to elucidate the effect of TUS on cortical brain dynamics. The VEP peak-to-peak amplitude was reversibly suppressed relative to baseline during TUS. Dynamic spectral analysis demonstrated a change in cortical oscillations when TUS is paired with visual sensory input. Sonication-associated microscopic displacements, as measured by MR-ARFI, correlated with the TUS-mediated suppression of visual evoked activity. TUS non-invasively delivered to LGN can neuromodulate visual activity and oscillatory dynamics in large mammalian brains.},

@article{Schrimpf2020,
	abstract = {A potentially organizing goal of the brain and cognitive sciences is to accurately explain domains of human intelligence as executable, neurally mechanistic models. Years of research have led to models that capture experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. We here advocate for taking the next step: integrating experimental results from many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when considered together, push mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as vision, language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models. This perspective discusses the advantages and the challenges of this approach and proposes specific steps to achieve this goal in the domain of visual intelligence with the case study of an integrative benchmarking platform called Brain-Score.},

	abstract = {The response to contrast is one of the most important functions of the macaque primary visual cortex, V1, but up to now there has not been an adequate theory for it. To fill this gap in our understanding of cortical function, we built and analyzed a new large-scale, biologically constrained model of the input layer, 4Cα, of macaque V1. We called the new model CSY2. We challenged CSY2 with a three-parameter family of visual stimuli that varied in contrast, orientation, and spatial frequency. CSY2 accurately simulated experimental data and made many new predictions. It accounted for 1) the shapes of firing-rate-versus-contrast functions, 2) orientation and spatial frequency tuning versus contrast, and 3) the approximate contrast-invariance of cortical activity maps. Post-analysis revealed that the mechanisms that were needed to produce the successful simulations of contrast response included strong recurrent excitation and inhibition that find dynamic equilibria across the cortical surface, dynamic feedback between L6 and L4, and synaptic dynamics like inhibitory synaptic depression.},

Second, the transformation scales the neural responses in the new coordinate frame by a gain factor that depends on the image contents.},

Physiological studies have confirmed the existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms; and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.},

@article{Kaneko2020,
	abstract = {Colors are represented in the cone-opponent signals, L-M versus S cones, at least up to the level of inputs to the primary visual cortex. We explored the hue selective responses in early cortical visual areas through recordings of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), elicited by a flickering checkerboard whose color smoothly swept around the hue circle defined in a cone-opponent color space. If cone opponency dominates hue representation in the source of SSVEP signals, SSVEP amplitudes as a function of hue should form a profile that is line-symmetric along the cardinal axes of the cone-opponent color space. Observed SSVEP responses were clearly chromatic ones with increased SSVEP amplitudes and reduced response latencies for higher contrast conditions. The overall elliptic amplitude profile was significantly tilted away from the cardinal axes to have the highest amplitudes in the "lime-magenta" direction, indicating that the hue representation in question is not dominated by cone-opponency. The observed SSVEP amplitude hue profile was better described as a summation of a perceptual response and cone-opponent responses with a larger weight to the former. These results indicate that hue representations in the early visual cortex, measured by the SSVEP technique, are possibly related to perceptual color contrast.},

@article{Li2022,
	abstract = {Studies of color perception have led to mechanistic models of how cone-opponent signals from retinal ganglion cells are integrated to generate color appearance. But it is unknown how this hypothesized integration occurs in the brain. Here we show that cone-opponent signals transmitted from retina to primary visual cortex (V1) are integrated through highly organized circuits within V1 to implement the color opponent interactions required for color appearance. Combining intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISI) and 2-photon calcium imaging (2PCI) at single cell resolution, we demonstrate cone-opponent functional domains (COFDs) that combine L/M cone-opponent and S/L + M cone-opponent signals following the rules predicted from psychophysical studies of color perception. These give rise to an orderly organization of hue preferences of the neurons within the COFDs and the generation of hue "pinwheels". Thus, spatially organized neural circuits mediate an orderly transition from cone-opponency to color appearance that begins in V1.},

@article{Katyal2018,
	abstract = {Neural suppression plays an important role in cortical function, including sensory, memory, and motor systems. It remains, however, relatively poorly understood. A paradigmatic case arises when conflicting images are presented to the two eyes. These images can compete for awareness, and one is usually strongly suppressed. The mechanisms that resolve such interocular conflict remain unclear. Suppression could arise solely from "winner-take-all" competition between neurons responsive to each eye. Alternatively, suppression could also depend upon neurons detecting interocular conflict. Here, we provide physiological evidence in human visual cortex for the latter: suppression depends upon conflict-sensitive neurons. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), and used the logic of selective adaptation. The amplitude of SSVEP responses at intermodulation frequencies strengthened as interocular conflict in the stimulus increased, suggesting the presence of neurons responsive to conflict. Critically, adaptation to conflict both reduced this SSVEP effect, and increased the amount of conflict needed to produce perceptual suppression. The simplest account of these results is that interocular-conflict-sensitive neurons exist in human cortex: adaptation likely reduced the responsiveness of these neurons which in turn raised the amount of conflict required to produce perceptual suppression. Similar mechanisms may be used to resolve other varieties of perceptual conflict.},

@article{Chen2021,
	abstract = {Color vision in humans starts with three types of cones (short [S], medium [M], and long [L] wavelengths) in the retina and three retinal and subcortical cardinal mechanisms, which linearly combine cone signals into the luminance channel (L + M), the red-green channel (L - M), and the yellow-blue channel (S-(L + M)). Chromatic mechanisms at the cortical level, however, are less well characterized. The present study investigated such higher-order chromatic mechanisms by recording electroencephalograms (EEGs) on human observers in a noise masking paradigm. Observers viewed colored stimuli that consisted of a target embedded in noise. Color directions of the target and noise varied independently and systematically in an isoluminant plane of color space. The target was flickering on-off at 3 Hz, eliciting steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses. As a result, the masking strength could be estimated from the SSVEP amplitude in the presence of 6 Hz noise. Masking was strongest (i.e. target eliciting smallest SSVEPs) when the target and noise were along the same color direction, and was weakest (i.e. target eliciting highest SSVEPs) when the target and noise were along orthogonal directions. This pattern of results was observed both when the target color varied along the cardinal and intermediate directions, which is evidence for higher-order chromatic mechanisms tuned to intermediate axes. The SSVEP result can be well predicted by a model with multiple broadly tuned chromatic mechanisms. In contrast, a model with only cardinal mechanisms failed to account for the data. These results provide strong electrophysiological evidence for multiple chromatic mechanisms in the early visual cortex of humans.},

Estimating the activity of deep sources from MEG and EEG (M/EEG) data is thus a challenging issue. Here, we review the influence of geometric parameters (location/orientation) on M/EEG signals produced by the main deep brain structures (amygdalo-hippocampal complex, thalamus and some basal ganglia). We then discuss several methods that have been utilized to solve the issues and localize or quantify the M/EEG contribution from deep neural currents. These methods rely on realistic forward models of subcortical regions or on introducing strong dynamical priors on inverse solutions that are based on biologically plausible neural models, such as those used in dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for M/EEG.},

	abstract = {Subcortical structures are involved in many healthy and pathological brain processes. It is crucial for many studies to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the ability to detect subcortical generators. This study aims to assess the source localization accuracy and to compare the characteristics of three inverse operators in the specific case of subcortical generators. MEG has a low sensitivity to subcortical sources mainly because of their distance from sensors and their complex cyto-architecture. However, we show that using a realistic anatomical and electrophysiological model of deep brain activity (DBA), the sources make measurable contributions to MEG sensors signals. Furthermore, we study the point-spread and cross-talk functions of the wMNE, sLORETA and dSPM inverse operators to characterize distortions in cortical and subcortical regions and to study how noise-normalization methods can improve or bias accuracy. We then run Monte Carlo simulations with neocortical and subcortical activations. In the case of single hippocampus patch activations, the results indicate that MEG can indeed localize the generators in the head and the body of the hippocampus with good accuracy. We then tackle the question of simultaneous cortical and subcortical activations. wMNE can detect hippocampal activations that are embedded in cortical activations that have less than double their amplitude, but it does not completely correct the bias to more superficial sources. dSPM and sLORETA can still detect hippocampal activity above this threshold, but such detection might include the creation of ghost deeper sources. Finally, using the DBA model, we showed that the detection of weak thalamic modulations of ongoing brain activity is possible.},

Moreover, steady state visual-evoked potentials evoked by the unperceived but commonly experienced video-screen flicker were recorded in the LGN, optic radiation, and V1/V2 visual areas. This study provides topographic and temporal propagation characteristics of steady state visual-evoked potentials along human visual pathways. We discuss the possible relationship between the oscillating signal recorded in subcortical and cortical areas and the electroencephalogram abnormalities observed in patients suffering from photosensitive epilepsy, particularly video-game epilepsy.

@article{Dougherty2019,
	abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) receives the main outputs of both eyes and relays those signals to the visual cortex. Each retina projects to separate layers of the LGN so that each LGN neuron is innervated by a single eye. In line with this anatomical separation, visual responses of almost all of LGN neurons are driven by one eye only. Nonetheless, many LGN neurons are sensitive to what is shown to the other eye as their visual responses differ when both eyes are stimulated compared to when the driving eye is stimulated in isolation. This, predominantly suppressive, binocular modulation of LGN responses might suggest that the LGN is the first location in the primary visual pathway where the outputs from the two eyes interact. Indeed, the LGN features several anatomical structures that would allow for LGN neurons responding to one eye to modulate neurons that respond to the other eye. However, it is also possible that binocular response modulation in the LGN arises indirectly as the LGN also receives input from binocular visual structures. Here we review the extant literature on the effects of binocular stimulation on LGN spiking responses, highlighting findings from cats and primates, and evaluate the neural circuits that might mediate binocular response modulation in the LGN.},

	abstract = {There is clear evidence that spatial attention increases neural responses to attended stimuli in extrastriate visual areas and, to a lesser degree, in earlier visual areas. Other evidence shows that neurons representing unattended locations can also be suppressed. However, the extent to which enhancement and suppression is observed, their stimulus dependence, and the stages of the visual system at which they are expressed remains poorly understood. Using fMRI we set out to characterize both the task and stimulus dependence of neural responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), primary visual cortex (V1), and visual motion area (V5) in humans to determine where suppressive and facilitatory effects of spatial attention are expressed. Subjects viewed a lateralized drifting grating stimulus, presented at multiple stimulus contrasts, and performed one of three tasks designed to alter the spatial location of their attention. In retinotopic representations of the stimulus location, we observed increasing attention-dependent facilitation and decreasing dependence on stimulus contrast moving up the visual hierarchy from the LGN to V5. However, in the representations of unattended locations of the LGN and V1, we observed suppression, which was not significantly dependent on the attended stimulus contrast. These suppressive effects were also found in the pulvinar, which has been frequently associated with attention. We provide evidence, therefore, for a spatially selective suppressive mechanism that acts at a subcortical level.},

	abstract = {Attentional mechanisms are important for selecting relevant information and filtering out irrelevant information from cluttered visual scenes. Selective attention has previously been shown to affect neural activity in both extrastriate and striate visual cortex. Here, evidence from functional brain imaging shows that attentional response modulation is not confined to cortical processing, but can occur as early as the thalamic level. We found that attention modulated neural activity in the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in several ways: it enhanced neural responses to attended stimuli, attenuated responses to ignored stimuli and increased baseline activity in the absence of visual stimulation. The LGN, traditionally viewed as the gateway to visual cortex, may also serve as a 'gatekeeper' in controlling attentional response gain.},

@article{Sherman1996,
	abstract = {The thalamus has long been seen as responsible for relaying information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

Accordingly, visual processing in the LGN is continuously influenced by previous patterns of activity. This study examines the temporal properties of feedforward and feedback pathways between the LGN and V1 in the macaque monkey to provide a lower bound on how quickly the cortex can influence the LGN. In so doing, we identified a subclass of corticogeniculate neurons that receives direct, suprathreshold input from the LGN that is similar in latency to that directed to other recipient neurons (4.2 +/- 0.4 vs 4.0 +/- 0.2 ms). These neurons also provide feedback to the LGN that is significantly shorter in latency than that supplied by corticogeniculate neurons lacking LGN input (5.1 +/- 1.3 vs 11.1 +/- 2.3 ms, respectively). Across our sample of corticogeniculate neurons, the shortest combined visual response latency and feedback latency was 37 ms (mean, 52.5 +/- 3.8 ms), indicating that visual signals can rapidly travel from the periphery to the cortex and back to the LGN.},

@article{Minarik2023,
	abstract = {Frequency tagging has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for identifying representational-specific neuronal activity in the auditory and visual domains. However, the slow flicker (<30 Hz) applied in conventional frequency tagging studies is highly visible and might entrain endogenous neuronal oscillations. Hence, stimulation at faster frequencies that is much less visible and does not interfere with endogenous brain oscillatory activity is a promising new tool. In this study, we set out to examine the optimal stimulation parameters of rapid frequency tagging (RFT/RIFT) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) by quantifying the effects of stimulation frequency, size and position of the flickering patch. Rapid frequency tagging using flickers above 50 Hz results in almost invisible stimulation which does not interfere with slower endogenous oscillations; however, the signal is weaker as compared to tagging at slower frequencies so certainty over the optimal parameters of stimulation delivery are crucial. The here presented results examining the frequency range between 60 Hz and 96 Hz suggest that RFT induces brain responses with decreasing strength up to about 84 Hz. In addition, even at the smallest flicker patch (2$\,^{\circ}$) focally presented RFT induces a significant and measurable oscillatory brain signal (steady state visual evoked potential/field, SSVEP/F) at the stimulation frequency (66 Hz); however, the elicited response increases with patch size. While focal RFT presentation elicits the strongest response, off-centre presentations do generally mainly elicit a measureable response if presented below the horizontal midline. Importantly, the results also revealed considerable individual differences in the neuronal responses to RFT stimulation. Finally, we discuss the comparison of oscillatory measures (coherence and power) and sensor types (planar gradiometers and magnetometers) in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Based on our extensive findings we set forward concrete recommendations for using rapid frequency tagging in human cognitive neuroscience investigations.},

@article{Herrmann2001,
	abstract = {The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color, are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30-80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. If neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Fatigue deteriorates the performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) system; thus, reliable detection of fatigue is the first step to counter this problem. The fatigue evaluated by means of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has been studied in many research projects, but widely different results have been reported. Moreover, there is scant research when considering the fatigue on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI. Therefore, nowadays, fatigue detection is not a completely solved topic. In the current work, the issues found in the literature that led to the differences in the results are identified and saved by performing a new experiment on an SSVEP-based BCI system. The experiment was long enough to produce fatigue in the users, and different SSVEP stimulation ranges were used. Additionally, the EEG features commonly reported in the literature (EEG rhythms powers, SNR, etc.) were calculated as well as newly proposed features (spectral features and Lempel-Ziv complexity). The analysis was carried out on O1, Oz and O2 channels. This work found a tendency of displacement from high-frequency rhythms to low-frequency ones, and thus, better EEG features should present a similar behaviour. Then, the 'relative power' of EEG rhythms, the rates (θ + α)/β, α/β and θ/β, some spectral features (central and mean frequencies, asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients, etc.) and Lempel-Ziv complexity are proposed as reliable EEG features for fatigue detection. Hence, this set of features may be used to construct a more trustworthy fatigue index.},

@article{Wang2023,
	abstract = {To maintain a stable and clear image of the world, our eyes reflexively follow the direction in which a visual scene is moving. Such gaze-stabilization mechanisms reduce image blur as we move in the environment. In non-primate mammals, this behaviour is initiated by retinal output neurons called ON-type direction-selective ganglion cells (ON-DSGCs), which detect the direction of image motion and transmit signals to brainstem nuclei that drive compensatory eye movements1. However, ON-DSGCs have not yet been identified in the retina of primates, raising the possibility that this reflex is mediated by cortical visual areas. Here we mined single-cell RNA transcriptomic data from primate retina to identify a candidate ON-DSGC. We then combined two-photon calcium imaging, molecular identification and morphological analysis to reveal a population of ON-DSGCs in the macaque retina. The morphology, molecular signature and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-dependent mechanisms that underlie direction selectivity in primate ON-DSGCs are highly conserved with those in other mammals. We further identify a candidate ON-DSGC in human retina. The presence of ON-DSGCs in primates highlights the need to examine the contribution of subcortical retinal mechanisms to normal and aberrant gaze stabilization in the developing and mature visual system.},

The magnitude and kinetics of light responses in each ganglion cell varied nonlinearly with stimulus strength but in a manner that was independent of the cone of origin after accounting for the overall input strength of each cone. Based on this property of independence, the receptive field profile of an individual ganglion cell could be well estimated from responses to stimulation of each cone individually.

METHODS: EEG was recorded while subjects attended to flickering LEDs in either the right or left visual hemifield and responded by a button press to isoluminant color changes (targets).
RESULTS: Target isoluminant color changes elicited the typical ERP components P1, N1, N2 and P3, which were enhanced for attended targets compared to unattended targets. Consistent with previous findings, SSVEP amplitude was enlarged for attended flicker stimuli at posterior electrode sites contralateral to the attended visual hemifield. In addition, significant correlations were found between the N1, N2 and the SSVEP attention effects, whereas no such correlations were found between the P1, P3 and SSVEP attention effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the SSVEP and ERP reflect partially overlapping attentional mechanisms that facilitate the discriminative processing of stimuli at attended locations.},

@article{Chota2024,
	abstract = {Visual working memory (VWM) allows storing goal-relevant information to guide future behavior. Prior work suggests that VWM is spatially organized and relies on spatial attention directed toward locations at which memory items were encoded, even if location is task-irrelevant. Importantly, attention often needs to be dynamically redistributed between locations, for example, in preparation for an upcoming probe. Very little is known about how attentional resources are distributed between multiple locations during a VWM task and even less about the dynamic changes governing such attentional shifts over time. This is largely due to the inability to use behavioral outcomes to reveal fast dynamic changes within trials. We here demonstrated that EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) successfully track the dynamic allocation of spatial attention during a VWM task. Participants were presented with to-be-memorized gratings and distractors at two distinct locations, tagged with flickering discs. This allowed us to dynamically track attention allocated to memory and distractor items via their coupling with space by quantifying the amplitude and coherence of SSVEP responses in the EEG signal to flickering stimuli at the former memory and distractor locations. SSVEP responses did not differ between memory and distractor locations during early maintenance. However, shortly before probe comparison, we observed a decrease in SSVEP coherence over distractor locations indicative of a reallocation of spatial attentional resources. RTs were shorter when preceded by stronger decreases in SSVEP coherence at distractor locations, likely reflecting attentional shifts from the distractor to the probe or memory location. We demonstrate that SSVEPs can inform about dynamic processes in VWM, even if location does not have to be reported by participants. This finding not only supports the notion of a spatially organized VWM but also reveals that SSVEPs betray a dynamic prioritization process of working memory items and locations over time that is directly predictive of memory performance.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that visual attention does not always exactly follow gaze direction, leading to the concepts of overt and covert attention. However, it is not yet clear how such covert shifts of visual attention to peripheral regions impact the processing of the targets we directly foveate as they move in our visual field. The current study utilised the co-registration of eye-position and EEG recordings while participants tracked moving targets that were embedded with a 30 Hz frequency tag in a Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) paradigm. When the task required attention to be divided between the moving target (overt attention) and a peripheral region where a second target might appear (covert attention), the SSVEPs elicited by the tracked target at the 30 Hz frequency band were significantly, but transiently, lower than when participants did not have to covertly monitor for a second target. Our findings suggest that neural responses of overt attention are only briefly reduced when attention is divided between covert and overt areas. This neural evidence is in line with theoretical accounts describing attention as a pool of finite resources, such as the perceptual load theory. Altogether, these results have practical implications for many real-world situations where covert shifts of attention may discretely reduce visual processing of objects even when they are directly being tracked with the eyes.},

@article{Morgan1996,
	abstract = {Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from the scalp of human subjects who were cued to attend to a rapid sequence of alphanumeric characters presented to one visual half-field while ignoring a concurrent sequence of characters in the opposite half-field. These two-character sequences were each superimposed upon a small square background that was flickered at a rate of 8.6 Hz in one half-field and 12 Hz in the other half-field. The amplitude of the frequency-coded SSVEP elicited by either of the task-irrelevant flickering backgrounds was significantly enlarged when attention was focused upon the character sequence at the same location. This amplitude enhancement with attention was most prominent over occipital-temporal scalp areas of the right cerebral hemisphere regardless of the visual field of stimulation. These findings indicate that the SSVEP reflects an enhancement of neural responses to all stimuli that fall within the "spotlight" of spatial attention, whether or not the stimuli are task-relevant. Recordings of the SSVEP provide a new approach for studying the neural mechanisms and functional properties of selective attention to multi-element visual displays.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

	abstract = {Cognitive processes are almost exclusively investigated under highly controlled settings during which voluntary body movements are suppressed. However, recent animal work suggests differences in sensory processing between movement states by showing drastically changed neural responses in early visual areas between locomotion and stillness. Does locomotion also modulate visual cortical activity in humans, and what are the perceptual consequences? Our study shows that walking increased the contrast-dependent influence of peripheral visual input on central visual input. This increase is prevalent in stimulus-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP]) alongside perceptual performance. Ongoing alpha oscillations (approximately 10 Hz) further positively correlated with the walking-induced changes of SSVEP amplitude, indicating the involvement of an altered inhibitory process during walking. The results predicted that walking leads to an increased processing of peripheral visual input. A second study indeed showed an increased contrast sensitivity for peripheral compared to central stimuli when subjects were walking. Our work shows complementary neurophysiological and behavioural evidence corroborating animal findings that walking leads to a change in early visual neuronal activity in humans. That neuronal modulation due to walking is indeed linked to specific perceptual changes extends the existing animal work.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that responses in sensory cortex are modulated by factors beyond direct sensory stimulation. In primary visual cortex (V1), for instance, responses increase with locomotion. Here we show that this increase is accompanied by a profound change in spatial integration. We recorded from V1 neurons in head-fixed mice placed on a spherical treadmill. We characterized spatial integration and found that the responses of most neurons were suppressed by large stimuli. As in primates, this surround suppression increased with stimulus contrast. These effects were captured by a divisive normalization model, where the numerator originates from a central region driving the neuron and the denominator originates from a larger suppressive field. We then studied the effects of locomotion and found that it markedly reduced surround suppression, allowing V1 neurons to integrate over larger regions of visual space. Locomotion had two main effects: it increased spontaneous activity, and it weakened the suppressive signals mediating normalization, relative to the driving signals. We conclude that a fundamental aspect of visual processing, spatial integration, is controlled by an apparently unrelated factor, locomotion. This control might operate through the mechanisms that are in place to deliver surround suppression.},

@article{Lee1990,
	abstract = {We measured the sensitivity of macaque ganglion cells to luminance and chromatic sinusoidal modulation. Phasic ganglion cells of the magnocellular pathway (M-pathway) were the more sensitive to luminance modulation, and tonic ganglion cells of the parvocellular pathway (P-pathway) were more sensitive to chromatic modulation. With decreasing retinal illuminance, phasic ganglion cells' temporal sensitivity to luminance modulation changed in a manner that paralleled psychophysical data. The same was true for tonic cells and chromatic modulation. Taken together, the data suggest strongly that the cells of the M-pathway form the physiological substrate for detection of luminance modulation and the cells of the P-pathway the substrate for detection of chromatic modulation. However, at high light levels, intrusion of a so-called luminance mechanism near 10 Hz in psychophysical detection of chromatic modulation is probably due to responses in the M-pathway, arising primarily from a nonlinearity of cone summation. Both phasic and tonic ganglion cells responded to frequencies higher than can be psychophysically detected. This suggests that central mechanisms, acting as low-pass filters, modify these cells' signals, though the corner frequency is lower for the P-pathway than for the M-pathway. For both cell types, the response phase at different frequencies was consistent with the cells' description as linear filters with a fixed time delay.},

@article{Solomon2005,
	abstract = {Although the response of a neuron in the visual cortex generally grows nonlinearly with contrast, the spatial tuning of the cell remains stable. This is thought to reflect the activity of a contrast gain control ("normalization") that has very broad tuning on the relevant stimulus dimension. Contrast invariant tuning on a particular dimension is probably necessary for reliable representation of stimuli on that dimension. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), V1, and V2 of anesthetized macaque, we measured chromatic tuning of neurons at several contrasts to characterize the gain controls and identify cells that might be important for representing color. We estimated separately the chromatic signature of the linear receptive field and that of the gain control. In the LGN, we found normalization in magnocellular cells and cells receiving excitatory S-cone input but not in parvocellular cells or those receiving inhibitory S-cone input. We found normalization in all types of cortical neurons. Among cells that preferred achromatic modulation, or modulation along intermediate directions in color space (making them responsive to both achromatic and chromatic stimuli), normalization was driven by mechanisms tuned to a restricted range of directions in color space, close to achromatic. As a result, chromatic tuning varied with contrast. Among the relatively few cells that strongly preferred chromatic modulation, normalization was driven by mechanisms sensitive to modulation along all directions in color space, especially isoluminant. As a result, chromatic tuning changed little with contrast. To the extent that contrast invariant tuning is important in representing chromaticity, relatively few cortical neurons are involved.},

	abstract = {The discharges of single neurones in the parvocellular and magnocellular laminae of the macaque's lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) were recorded with glass-insulated tungsten micro-electrodes. Linearity of spatial summation was examined using the test devised by Hochstein & Shapley (1976). 2 of 272 parvocellular units and 6 of 105 magnocellular units showed clearly non-linear spatial summation. A quantitative index of non-linearity did not suggest the existence of a distinct 'non-linear' class of magnocellular unit. Spatial contrast sensitivity to moving gratings was measured by a tracking procedure in which contrast was adjusted to elicit a reliable modulation of discharge. With the exception of cells that were driven by blue-sensitive cones, measurements of contrast sensitivity did not reveal distinct subgroups of parvocellular units. All had low sensitivity, and those with receptive fields in the fovea could resolve spatial frequencies of up to 40 cycles deg-1. Magnocellular units had substantially higher sensitivity, but poorer spatial resolution. The higher sensitivities of magnocellular units led to their giving saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast. Responses of parvocellular units were rarely saturated by any stimulus. At any one eccentricity the receptive fields of parvocellular units had smaller centres than did those of magnocellular units. Receptive fields of magnocellular units driven by the ipsilateral eye had larger receptive fields than did those driven by the contralateral eye. Parvocellular units were most sensitive to stimuli modulated at temporal frequencies close to 10 Hz; magnocellular units to stimuli modulated at frequencies nearer 20 Hz. The loss of sensitivity as temporal frequency fell below optimum was more marked in magnocellular than parvocellular units. Changes in temporal frequency altered the shapes of the spatial contrast sensitivity curves of both parvocellular and magnocellular units. These changes could be explained by supposing that centre and surround have different temporal properties, and that the surround is relatively less sensitive to higher temporal frequencies.},

The RVS can be rendered on a computer screen by alternating graphical patterns, or with external light sources able to emit modulated light. The properties of an RVS (e.g., frequency, color) depend on the rendering device and influence the SSVEP characteristics. This affects the BCI information throughput and the levels of user safety and comfort. Literature on SSVEP-based BCIs does not generally provide reasons for the selection of the used rendering devices or RVS properties.

	abstract = {Attention is important for sufficient performance on many visual tasks. This has been shown using achromatic steady-state and pattern-reversal VEPs. Waveform characteristics typically attenuate when attending to distractor stimuli and ignoring VEP stimuli. Chromatic pattern-onset responses have not been tested under conditions of selective attention: as they can be used in clinical settings to test color vision, it is important to know what effects attentional shifts would have on this response. In the present study chromatic pattern-onset VEPs were recorded using spatially divided and spatially contiguous VEP and distractor stimuli. VEP stimuli were 1 cycle.deg(-1) horizontal sine wave patterns (onset mode 100 ms on/400 ms off) used to selectively modulate the L-M and S-(L+M) visual pathways. Distracter stimuli were letters. Subjects attended to either the letters or the gratings and pressed a button when a predetermined stimulus appeared. In Experiment one, VEP and distractor stimuli were superimposed and spatially contiguous. In Experiment two, stimuli were presented to different hemifields. No significant changes in waveform amplitude and latency were found between VEP and distractor attention conditions for either visual pathway. For the chromatic pattern-onset response, modulation of attention does not change responses either with spatially contiguous or spatially separate selective attention manipulations. Consequently, it may not be necessary to monitor attention during recording of this response.},

@article{Martinovic2018,
	abstract = {Cortical networks that process colour and luminance signals are often studied separately, although colour appearance depends on both colour and luminance. In fact, objects in everyday life are very rarely defined by only colour or only luminance, necessitating an investigation into combined processing of these signals. We used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to investigate (1) cortical summation of luminance and chromatic contrast and (2) attentional modulation of neural activity driven by competing stimuli that differ in chromoluminant content. Our stimuli combined fixed amounts of chromatic contrast from either of the two cone-opponent mechanisms (bluish and yellowish; reddish and greenish) with two different levels of positive luminance contrast. Our experiments found evidence of non-linear processing of combined colour and luminance signals, which most likely originates in V1-V3 neurons tuned to both colour and luminance. Differences between luminance contrast of stimuli were found to be a key determinant for the size of feature-based voluntary attentional effects in SSVEPs, with colours of lower contrast than the colour they were presented with receiving the highest level of attentional modulation. Our results indicate that colour and luminance contrast are processed interdependently, both in terms of perception and in terms of attentional selection, with a potential candidate mediating their link being stimulus appearance, which depends on both chromaticity and luminance.},

@article{Somers1999,
	abstract = {Selective visual attention can strongly influence perceptual processing, even for apparently low-level visual stimuli. Although it is largely accepted that attention modulates neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex, the extent to which attention operates in the first cortical stage, striate visual cortex (area V1), remains controversial. Here, functional MRI was used at high field strength (3 T) to study humans during attentionally demanding visual discriminations. Similar, robust attentional modulations were observed in both striate and extrastriate cortical areas. Functional mapping of cortical retinotopy demonstrates that attentional modulations were spatially specific, enhancing responses to attended stimuli and suppressing responses when attention was directed elsewhere. The spatial pattern of modulation reveals a complex attentional window that is consistent with object-based attention but is inconsistent with a simple attentional spotlight. These data suggest that neural processing in V1 is not governed simply by sensory stimulation, but, like extrastriate regions, V1 can be strongly and specifically influenced by attention.},

	abstract = {Attention is thought to enhance perceptual performance at attended locations through top-down attention signals that modulate activity in visual cortex. Here, we show that activity in early visual cortex is sustained during maintenance of attention in the absence of visual stimulation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in visual cortex while human subjects performed a visual detection task in which a variable-duration delay period preceded target presentation. Portions of cortical areas V1, V2, and V3 representing the attended part of the visual field exhibited sustained increases in activity throughout the delay period. Portions of these cortical areas representing peripheral, unattended parts of the visual field displayed sustained decreases in activity. The data were well fit by a model that assumed the sustained neural activity was constant in amplitude over a time period equal to that of the actual delay period for each trial. These results demonstrate that sustained attention responses are present in early visual cortex (including primary visual cortex), in the absence of a visual stimulus, and that these responses correlate with the allocation of visuospatial attention in both the spatial and temporal domains.},

@article{Murray2008,
	abstract = {Although visual spatial attention has been shown to increase activity as measured with both fMRI and electrophysiological techniques, significant differences in the results have been shown. fMRI studies have routinely demonstrated large signal increases to an attended versus unattended stimulus in early visual areas (V1-V3) whereas some previous electrophysiology research has either shown very small or no differences in spike rate. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that most previous fMRI studies have not differentiated between stimulus-evoked and baseline-shift changes in the response to an attended stimulus. Here, fMRI was used to separately measure stimulus-evoked and baseline-shift responses. In the first experiment, contrast-response functions to grating stimuli that were either attended or unattended were measured. The results show that the increases in fMRI signal associated with spatial attention are accounted for by a baseline shift. In a second experiment, spatial attention was fixed in a single location that isolated possible stimulus-evoked changes with attention. Consistent with the first experiment, no stimulus-evoked changes were found. These results potentially reconcile previous discrepant findings between fMRI studies and some neurophysiology studies of attention by demonstrating that the effects of spatial attention in early visual areas can be dominated by stimulus-independent shifts in baseline responses.},

Covert attention increased both the baseline activities and contrast gains in the five cortical areas. The effect on baseline can be decomposed into a transient trial-by-trial component and a component across an entire attention block. On average, increase in contrast gain accounted for approximately 88.0%, 28.5%, 12.7%, 35.9%, and 25.2% of the trial-by-trial effects of attention in the five areas, respectively, and 22.2%, 12.8%, 7.4%, 19.7%, and 17.3% of the total effects of attention in those areas, consistent with single-unit findings in V4 and MT.

On some trials the animals were instructed to pay attention to those stimuli, and on other trials they were instructed to pay attention to other stimuli outside the receptive field. In this way, orientation-tuning curves could be constructed from neuronal responses collected in two behavioral states: one in which those stimuli were attended by the animal and one in which those stimuli were ignored by the animal. We fit Gaussians to the neuronal responses to twelve different orientations for each behavioral state. Although attention enhanced the responses of V4 neurons (median 26% increase) and V1 neurons (median 8% increase), selectivity, as measured by the width of its orientation-tuning curve, was not systematically altered by attention. The effects of attention were consistent with a multiplicative scaling of the driven response to all orientations. We also found that attention did not cause systematic changes in the undriven activity of the neurons.},

	abstract = {This study quantified the magnitude and timing of selective attention effects across areas of the macaque visual system, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), lower cortical areas V1 and V2, and multiple higher visual areas in the dorsal and ventral processing streams. We used one stimulus configuration and behavioral paradigm, with simultaneous recordings from different areas to allow direct comparison of the distribution and timing of attention effects across the system. Streams of interdigitated auditory and visual stimuli were presented at a high rate with an irregular interstimulus interval (mean of 4/s). Attention to visual stimuli was manipulated by requiring subjects to make discriminative behavioral responses to stimuli in one sensory modality, ignoring all stimuli in the other. The attended modality was alternated across trial blocks, and difficulty of discrimination was equated across modalities. Stimulus presentation was gated, so that no stimuli were presented unless the subject gazed at the center of the visual stimulus display. Visual stimuli were diffuse light flashes differing in intensity or color and subtending 12 degrees centered at the point of gaze. Laminar event-related potential (ERP) and current source density (CSD) response profiles were sampled during multiple paired penetrations in multiple visual areas with linear array multicontact electrodes. Attention effects were assessed by comparing responses to specific visual stimuli when attended versus when visual stimuli were looked at the same way, but ignored. Effects were quantified by computing a modulation index (MI), a ratio of the differential CSD response produced by attention to the sum responses to attended and ignored visual stimuli. The average MI increased up levels of the lower visual pathways from none in the LGN to 0.0278 in V1 to 0.101 in V2 to 0.170 in V4. Above the V2 level, attention effects were larger in ventral stream areas (MI = 0. 152) than in dorsal stream areas (MI = 0.052). Although onset latencies were shortest in dorsal stream areas, attentional modulation of the early response was small relative to the stimulus-evoked response. Higher ventral stream areas showed substantial attention effects at the earliest poststimulus time points, followed by the lower visual areas V2 and V1. In all areas, attentional modulation lagged the onset of the stimulus-evoked response, and attention effects grew over the time course of the neuronal response. The most powerful, consistent, and earliest attention effects were those found to occur in area V4, during the 100-300 ms poststimulus interval. Smaller effects occurred in V2 over the same interval, and the bulk of attention effects in V1 were later. In the accompanying paper, we describe the physiology of attention effects in V1, V2 and V4.},

	abstract = {Of all areas studied in the accompanying study, attention effects were most consistent and well resolved in V4. In this study, to define some of the anatomical circuits and neural processes underlying the influence of attention, we examined the laminar distribution and physiology of attention effects in V4 and in two lower areas, V1 and V2. Laminar event-related potential (ERP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles allowed identification of processes occurring in the local ensembles, as well as their sequence and laminar distribution. These methods also permitted us to analyze the brain processes reflected in attention-sensitive components of the surface ERP. As outlined in the previous study, the first robust modulation by attention occurred in V4 during the 100-300 ms poststimulus interval. This is the time frame of the net refractoriness which follows the net local excitatory response to luminance increment. Over this interval, attention reduced CSD amplitudes and increased action potential firing rates, findings consistent with disinhibition as a mechanism for attention in V4. Similar effects were observed during the 100-300 ms time frame in V2. In V4, attention had no effect on the initial excitatory response at the depth of lamina 4, but it did produce large modulations in supragranular and deep laminae, origins of both feedforward and feedback projections. Attentional modulation in V2 was later than in V4 and concentrated in extragranular laminae, with no modulation of the initial layer 4 response. Attentional modulation in V1 was smaller and still later than that in V2 and was focused in the supragranular laminae. In this paradigm, attention did not modulate either the response in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the initial excitation in lamina 4C of V1. The timing of effects across areas and the laminar distribution of effects within areas indicate that attention effects are mediated by feedback projections. Moreover, our findings suggest that attention may increase the perceptual salience of stimuli by reducing stimulus-evoked refractoriness and/or inhibition in cortical ensembles. Finally, attentional modulation of transmembrane current flow in V4 produced a sustained negative deflection in the laminar ERP profile, that was manifested in the ERP over the occipital surface. This posits a mechanism for the 'selection negativity', a scalp ERP effect noted under similar experimental conditions in human subjects.},

@article{Marcus2002,
	abstract = {The responses of many neurons in primary visual cortex are modulated by stimuli outside the classical receptive field in ways that may contribute to integrative processes like scene segmentation. To explore this issue, single-unit neuronal responses were recorded in monkey cortical areas V1 and V2 to visual stimuli containing either a figure or a background pattern over the receptive field. Figures were defined either by orientation contrast or by illusory contours. In all conditions, the stimulation over the RF and its nearby surround was identical. Both figure types enhanced the average population response in V1 and V2. For orientation contrast figures, enhancement averaged 50% in V2 and 30% in V1; for illusory contour figures, the enhancement averaged 24% in V2 and 18% in V1. These differences were statistically significant for figure type but not for visual area. In V2, the latency of enhancement to illusory contour-defined figures was longer than that to orientation-defined figures. Neuronal responses were recorded while the monkey performed a directed-attention task. Enhancement to both figure types was observed even when attention was directed away from the figure. Attention slightly enhanced responses in V2, independent of figure type, but did not affect responses in V1. There was no discernible effect of attention on background firing rate in either V1 or V2. These results suggest that scene segmentation is a distributed process, in which neuronal signals at successive stages of the visual hierarchy and over time increasingly reflect the global structure of the image. This process occurs independent of directed visual attention.},

@article{Luck1997,
	abstract = {Many neurons in extrastriate visual cortex have large receptive fields, and this may lead to significant computational problems whenever multiple stimuli fall within a single field. Previous studies have suggested that when multiple stimuli fall within a cell's receptive field, they compete for the cell's response in a manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli. In the present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2, and V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm in which attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations. When two stimuli were presented simultaneously inside the cell's receptive field (which could be accomplished only in areas V2 and V4), we found that the cell's response was strongly influenced by which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of this attention effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition, the effects became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when only one of the two stimuli was located inside the receptive field. Attention thus modulated sensory responses primarily when two or more simultaneous stimuli competed for access to a neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention did not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single stimulus was inside the receptive field. In addition, the small receptive fields in this area precluded the simultaneous presentation of attended and ignored stimuli inside the receptive field, making it impossible to determine whether attention effects would be observed under the conditions that led to consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous firing rates in areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40% higher when attention was directed inside rather than outside the receptive field, even when no stimulus was present in the receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied according to the particular location within the receptive field that was attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a top-down signal that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the attended location.},

The most recent studies have used parametric manipulations of stimulus attributes such as orientation, direction of motion, and contrast to elucidate the form of the attentional mechanism. The results of these studies do not always agree. However, some of this inconsistency may be caused which attentional effects are considered, such as contrast gain, response gain, or a baseline shift in firing rate with attention. Here, seven studies of spatial and feature-based attention, ranging from monkey electrophysiological studies in V4 and MT to fMRI studies in human visual cortex, are reevaluated in the context of a single parametric model that incorporates a variety of ways in which attention can influence neuronal responses. This reanalysis shows that most, though not all, of these results can be explained by a similar combination of attentional mechanisms.},

We argue that the variety and complexity of the results reported in the literature emerge from the variety of empirical protocols that were used, such that the results observed in any one experiment depended on the stimulus conditions and the subject's attentional strategy, a notion that we define precisely in terms of the attention field in the model, but that has not typically been completely under experimental control.},

@article{Burr1987,
	abstract = {1. Visual evoked potentials (v.e.p.s) were recorded from human adults to investigate orientation-specific neural interactions. The stimuli were the sum of two gratings, sinusoidally modulated in space and time at different frequencies. Recordings were made for one grating (test) alone, and with another superimposed grating (mask), oriented parallel or orthogonal to the test. The amplitude and phase of the v.e.p.s at twice the test modulation frequency (second harmonic) was measured as a function of test contrast to produce contrast-response curves. 2. Orthogonal masks attenuated considerably the amplitude of v.e.p.s. The attenuation at any given contrast was approximately proportional, or multiplicative, lowering the slope of the contrast-response curve, without affecting significantly the extrapolated threshold. Parallel masks also attenuated v.e.p. amplitudes but in a different way, leaving the slope of the contrast-response curves unchanged, while elevating threshold. 3. The attenuation by orthogonal masks occurred over a wide range of test spatial frequencies, from 0.8 to 8 cycles/deg. For any given test spatial frequency, the most effective masks were those of spatial frequency similar to or lower than the test. Masks of spatial frequency 1.5 octaves higher than the test did not attenuate v.e.p. amplitudes. 4. The mask temporal frequency for maximal attenuation of v.e.p. amplitude was around 12 Hz, with stationary masks having little effect. 5. Under most conditions, the phase of the second harmonic of the v.e.p., increased with increasing contrast (phase advance). Superimposition of a parallel mask abolished phase advance, while orthogonal masks increased it. 6. Comparisons with single cortical unit and evoked potential recordings in cats suggest that the attenuation by orthogonal masks reflects intracortical inhibitory interactions between cell populations of different orientation preference.},

	abstract = {After a preliminary study of visual evoked potentials (VEPS) to a test grating seen in the presence of masks at different orientations, psychophysical data are presented showing the effects of adaptation and of masking on thresholds for detecting the same test grating. The test is a vertical grating of spatial frequency 2 cycles per degree; adapting and masking gratings differ from the test either in orientation or in spatial frequency. The effects of adaptation and masking are explained by a single mechanism model that assumes: (i) adaptation and masking both alter the contrast response (or transducer) function of the mechanism that detects the test; (ii) masks, but not adaptors, stimulate the mechanism that detects the test; and (iii) a test is detectable when it raises response level by a constant amount. The model incorporates two distinct tuning functions, a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. It accounts adequately for all the data, including the location and size of the facilitative dip found in some masking functions, the constant slopes of the threshold elevation segments of adaptation functions and the varying slopes of masking functions. It also predicts the sometimes surprising joint effects of adaptation followed by masking and of two masks operating simultaneously.},

We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) as well as EEG from two awake macaque monkeys while they passively fixated plaid stimuli with components counterphasing at different TFs. We observed asymmetric SSVEP response suppression by competing TFs (greater suppression for lower TFs), which further depended on the relative orientations of plaid components. A tuned normalization model, adapted to SSVEP responses, provided a good account of the suppression. Our results provide new insights into processing of temporally modulated visual stimuli.},

@article{Petrov2006,
	abstract = {When flanked by collinear Gabor patches, detection thresholds for a target Gabor patch improve by up to a factor of 2. This result has been interpreted as evidence for collinear facilitation. However, facilitation has been observed only for targets near detection threshold, where observers seem uncertain about the location and other properties of the stimulus. So the effect of the flankers may be to reduce this uncertainty. If this is true, then other cues to target location should produce a similar improvement in thresholds. To test this hypothesis, we measured contrast detection thresholds for a Gabor target alone, and in the presence of either a faint circle surrounding the target location, or two high-energy flanking Gabor patches. We also used an adaptive procedure to measure the slope of the psychometric function to determine whether the slopes were considerably lower in the presence of location cues or flanking Gabors, as predicted by signal detection theory when uncertainty is reduced. As observed previously, the presence of collinear flankers improved detection thresholds by a factor of two. Yet, on average, the circle alone accounted for the most of the facilitation; for three of our five observers, it improved thresholds as much as the collinear flankers. Other cues that specified target location produced similar improvements in detection thresholds. The slopes of the psychometric functions were much shallower in the presence of these location cues or the collinear flankers compared to the target-alone condition. This change in the slopes indicates that the threshold improvement is largely due to a significant reduction in uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Attentional cues may increase the detectability of a stimulus by increasing its signal-to-noise ratio (signal enhancement) or by increasing the efficiency of the observer's decision making by reducing uncertainty about the location of the stimulus (uncertainty reduction). Although signal enhancement has typically been found in detection tasks only when stimuli are backwardly masked, some recent studies have reported signal enhancement with unmasked stimuli under conditions of spatial uncertainty (E. L. Cameron, J. C. Tai, & M. Carrasco, 2002; M. Carrasco, C. Penpeci-Talgar, & M. Eckstein, 2000). To test whether these increases in sensitivity in unmasked displays were due to signal enhancement or uncertainty reduction, observers judged the orientation of unmasked Gabor patch stimuli in the presence or absence of fiducial markers that indicated their position in the display. Consistent with an uncertainty reduction hypothesis, cues produced large increases in sensitivity when stimuli were not localized perceptually but produced little or no systematic increase when they were localized by fiducial markers. The same general pattern of results was obtained with cues designed to engage the exogenous and endogenous orienting systems. The data suggest that, in practiced observers, the cuing effect for detecting unmasked stimuli is mainly due to uncertainty reduction.},

Similar results were obtained for color increment thresholds, indicating that the interference is specific to contrast modality. The effects are strong and robust over primary task difficulties and perceptual learning levels.

We used a peripheral precue (a small circle indicating the target location) to explore the effects of covert spatial attention on contrast sensitivity as assessed by orientation discrimination (Experiments 1-4), detection (Experiments 2 and 3) and localization (Experiment 3) tasks. In all four experiments the target (a Gabor patch ranging in spatial frequency from 0.5 to 10 cpd) was presented alone in one of eight possible locations equidistant from fixation. Contrast sensitivity was consistently higher for peripherally- than for neutrally-cued trials, even though we eliminated variables (distracters, global masks, local masks, and location uncertainty) that are known to contribute to an external noise reduction explanation of attention. When observers were presented with vertical and horizontal Gabor patches an external noise reduction signal detection model accounted for the cueing benefit in a discrimination task (Experiment 1). However, such a model could not account for this benefit when location uncertainty was reduced, either by: (a) Increasing overall performance level (Experiment 2); (b) increasing stimulus contrast to enable fine discriminations of slightly tilted suprathreshold stimuli (Experiment 3); and (c) presenting a local post-mask (Experiment 4). Given that attentional benefits occurred under conditions that exclude all variables predicted by the external noise reduction model, these results support the signal enhancement model of attention.},

	abstract = {We examined the effect of transient covert attention on the psychometric function for contrast sensitivity in an orientation discrimination task when the target was presented alone in the absence of distracters and visual masks. Transient covert attention decreased both the threshold (consistent with a contrast gain mechanism) and, less consistently, the slope of the psychometric function. We assessed performance at 8 equidistant locations (4.5 degrees eccentricity) and found that threshold and slope depended on target location-both were higher on the vertical than the horizontal meridian, particularly directly above fixation. All effects were robust across a range of spatial frequencies, and the visual field asymmetries increased with spatial frequency. Notwithstanding the dependence of the psychometric function on target location, attention improved performance to a similar extent across the visual field.Given that, in this study, we excluded all sources of external noise, and that we showed experimentally that spatial uncertainty cannot explain the present results, we conclude that the observed attentional benefit is consistent with signal enhancement.},

	abstract = {The effect of sustained spatial attention on a task-irrelevant grating displayed in the left visual field was studied by steady-state and transient visual evoked potentials (VEP). For the steady-state experiment, the task irrelevant grating was phase-reversed at different temporal frequencies. In the transient experiment the grating was reversed abruptly at low temporal frequency. In both conditions a target requiring visual attention was presented either in the left or in the right visual field, directing attention either to the left or to the right. VEPs amplitude enhancement by attention was observed on steady-state VEPs and on P100 and N140 transient VEPs components, confirming previous observations. Moreover, VEPs in the attended condition had shorter latency than VEPs in the unattended condition. The difference was about 15 ms with steady-state; with transient recording the lag was 7 ms for N60 and 10 ms for P100. The latency change of the N60 component, suggests that the modulation of attention on visual processing might be earlier than previously thought. A control experiment to assess the influence of eye movements on the test was also performed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of feature-selective attention have focused on situations in which attention is directed to one of two spatially superimposed stimuli of equal salience. While such overlapping stimuli should maximize stimulus interactions, it is still unknown how bottom-up biases favoring one or the other stimulus influence the efficiency of feature-selective attention. We examined the integration of bottom-up contrast and top-down feature-selection biases on stimulus processing. Two fully overlapping random dot kinematograms (RDKs) of light and dark dots were presented on a gray background of intermediate luminance. On each trial, human participants attended one RDK to detect brief coherent motion targets, while ignoring any events in the unattended RDK. Concurrently, through changes in background luminance, stimulus contrast could be set to five different levels: the stimuli could either be equal, or one of the two stimuli could have twice or four times the contrast of the other stimulus. This manipulation introduced a bottom-up bias toward the stimulus with the higher contrast while keeping the difference between the stimuli constant. Stimulus processing was measured by means of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). SSVEP amplitudes generally increased with higher contrast of the driving stimulus. At earlier levels of processing, attention increased the slope of this linear relation, i.e., attention multiplicatively enhanced SSVEP amplitudes. However, at later levels of processing, attention had an additive effect. These effects of attention can be attributed to the differential integration of gain enhancement and inhibitory stimulus competition at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy.},

@article{Cunningham2017,
	abstract = {{ Relatively little is known about the processes, both linear and nonlinear, by which signals are combined beyond V1. By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were ``coherent'' (looking like a checkerboard) and ``noncoherent'' (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not. A two-stage model of nonlinear summation involving conjunction detection with a logical AND gate described the data well, capturing the difference between coherent and noncoherent plaids over a wide array of possible response frequencies. Multistimulus frequency-tagged EEG in combination with computational modeling may be a very valuable tool in studying the conjunction of these signals. In the current study the results suggest a second-order mechanism responding selectively to coherent plaid patterns. }},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effect of attention on the contrast response curves of steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to counter-phased sinusoidal gratings. The 1 cyc/deg gratings were modulated either in luminance or chromaticity (equiluminant red-green). The luminance grating counter-phased at 9 Hz (to favour activation of the magno-cellular system), and the chromatic grating at 2.5 Hz (to favour activation of the parvo-cellular system). Attention was directed towards the gratings (displayed in the left visual field) by requiring subjects to detect and respond to randomly occurring changes in contrast. In the control condition, attention towards the grating was minimised by requiring subjects to detect a target letter amongst distracters briefly flashed in the contra-lateral visual field. Attention increased VEP amplitudes for both luminance and chromatic stimuli, more so at high than at low contrasts, increasing the slope of the contrast amplitude curves (over the non-saturating range of contrasts). The estimates of contrast threshold from extrapolation of amplitudes were unaffected by attention. Attention also changed the VEP phases, but only for luminance gratings, where it acted to reduce the magnitude of phase advance with contrast. Attention had no effect on the average phases for chromatic gratings. The results are consistent with the notion that attention acts on cortical gain control mechanisms, which are known to be different for the magno- and parvo-cellular systems.},

	abstract = {The cruciform hypothesis states that if a visual evoked potential component originates in V1, then stimuli placed in the upper versus lower visual fields will generate responses with opposite polarity at the scalp. This diagnostic has been used by many studies as a definitive marker of V1 sources. To provide an empirical test of the validity of the cruciform hypothesis, we generated forward models of cortical areas V1, V2 and V3 that were based on realistic estimates of the 3-D shape of these areas and the shape and conductivity of the brain, skull and scalp. Functional MRI was used to identify the location of early visual areas and anatomical MRI data was used to construct detailed cortical surface reconstructions and to generate boundary element method forward models of the electrical conductivity of each participant's head. These two data sets for each subject were used to generate simulated scalp activity from the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of each visual area that correspond to the lower and upper visual field representations, respectively. The predicted topographies show that sources in V1 do not fully conform to the cruciform sign-reversal. Moreover, contrary to the model, retinotopic visual areas V2 and V3 show polarity reversals for upper and lower field stimuli. The presence of a response polarity inversion for upper versus lower field stimuli is therefore an insufficient criterion for identifying responses as having originated in V1.},

It was found that a linear relation exists between the log. of contrast and the amplitude of the evoked potential.3. Extrapolation to zero amplitude voltage of the regression line between the amplitude of the evoked potential and log. contrast predicts the psychophysical threshold. This law was found to hold over the wide range of spatial frequencies tested.4. Below 3 c/deg the results are best fitted with two regression lines; one of these is generated from the foveal and the other from the parafoveal representation in the cortex.5. The slope of the regression lines was found to be almost independent of either the spatial frequency or the area of the stimulus grating.6. The slope of the regression lines could be markedly increased by using as a stimulus either two different spatial frequencies, or two different orientations, presented simultaneously.7. Using the evoked potential the selectivity to orientation was found to be so high that a channel was not influenced by another orientation 15 degrees away.8. The channels selectively sensitive to spatial frequency were highly selective and were not influenced by another spatial frequency one octave removed in spatial frequency.9. It is concluded that in man there exist neurones highly selective to both orientation and spatial frequency.},

But masks have greater effects than adaptors, the effect of an orthogonal mask, or one two octaves higher in spatial frequency, being about the same as a parallel adaptor of the same spatial frequency as the pedestal grating. The results are explained by a model of Ross and Speed [(1991) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 246, 61-69] that assumes that masks and adaptors both reposition the transducer function of contrast sensitive mechanisms and that masks, but not adaptors, also stimulate the detecting mechanism.},

@article{Groen2022,
	abstract = {Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including subadditive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in duration, interstimulus interval (ISI) and contrast. Aggregating data across patients from both sexes yielded 98 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1-V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several nonlinear features. Peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations, the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs, and response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model composed of a small set of canonical neuronal operations, that is, linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sensory inputs and neural responses change continuously over time. It is especially challenging to understand a system that has both dynamic inputs and outputs. Here, we use a computational modeling approach that specifies computations to convert a time-varying input stimulus to a neural response time course, and we use this to predict neural activity measured in the human visual cortex. We show that this computational model predicts a wide variety of complex neural response shapes, which we induced experimentally by manipulating the duration, repetition, and contrast of visual stimuli. By comparing data and model predictions, we uncover systematic properties of temporal dynamics of neural signals, allowing us to better understand how the brain processes dynamic sensory information.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the neural generators of the early components of the visual-evoked potential (VEP) to pattern-reversal gratings. Multichannel scalp recordings of VEPs and dipole modeling techniques were combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and retinotopic mapping in order to estimate the locations of the cortical sources giving rise to VEP components in the first 200 ms poststimulus. Dipole locations were seeded to visual cortical areas in which fMRI activations were elicited by the same stimuli. The results provide strong evidence that the first major component of the VEP elicited by a pattern-reversal stimulus (N75/P85) arises from surface-negative activity in the primary visual cortex (area V1). Subsequent waveform components could be accounted for by dipoles that were in close proximity to fMRI activations in the following cortical areas: P95 (area MT/V5), P125/N135 (area V1), N150 (transverse parietal sulcus, TPS), N160 (ventral occipital areas VP, V4v, and V4/V8), and N180 (dorsal occipital areas V3A/V7). These results provide a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the cortical origins of the pattern-reversal VEP, which should enhance its utility in both clinical and basic studies of visual-perceptual processing.},

	abstract = {Autistic adults commonly experience sensory reactivity differences. Sensory hyperreactivity is frequently researched, whilst hyporeactivity and seeking, and experiences across domains, e.g., vision, are often neglected. Therefore, we aimed to understand more about the sensory experiences of autistic adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study, co-produced with stakeholders; recruiting 49 autistic adults who completed an online survey. Firstly, quantitative results and content analysis enhanced our understanding of sensory input/contexts associated with sensory hyperreactivity, hyporeactivity, and seeking across modalities. Secondly, thematic analysis developed themes relating to 'Outcomes', 'Control', 'Tolerance and management', and 'The role of other people', informing a theoretical model of sensory reactivity differences in autistic adults. These findings have implications for support services and improving quality of life for autistic adults.},

@article{Pei2014,
	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence from electrophysiological studies that low-level visual processing is atypical in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Abnormalities in early stages of sensory processing are of interest because they could lead to downstream functional deficits in social or cognitive domains. Using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), we studied how well spatial information is transmitted over a wide range of spatial frequencies (2-30 cycles/deg), including those at the limit of visibility (visual acuity). SSVEPs were recorded over 128 channels in 16 ASD participants between 5 and 17 years old and 17 age-matched, neurotypical (NT) participants. We observed a selective reduction of the amplitude of the SSVEP second harmonic pattern reversal response between 5 and 17 cycles/deg. Responses measured at the fourth harmonic were normal at all spatial frequencies tested, as were responses at the lowest and highest spatial frequencies at the second harmonic. The reduction of second harmonic responses occurred preferentially over right occipital electrodes. Because response abnormalities are restricted to a specific response harmonic and to specific ranges of spatial frequency, we can rule out nonspecific differences between the ASD participants and the NT controls. This particular pattern of loss, combined with the observed exaggeration of the loss over the right hemisphere, suggests that a highly specific neural substrate early in the visual pathway is compromised in ASD.},

@article{Hu2023,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent investigations observed substantial enhancements in binocular balance, visual acuity, and stereovision among older children and adults with amblyopia by patching the amblyopic eye (i.e., inverse patching) for 2 h daily over 2 months. Despite these promising findings, the precise neural mechanisms underlying inverse patching remain elusive. This study endeavors to delve deeper into the neural alterations induced by inverse patching, focusing on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). We specifically investigate the changes in SSVEPs following monocular deprivation of either the fellow eye or the amblyopic eye in older amblyopic children and adults.
METHOD: Ten participants (17.60 $\pm$ 2.03 years old; mean $\pm$ SEM), clinically diagnosed with anisometropic amblyopia, were recruited for this study. Each participant underwent a 120 min patching session on their fellow eye on the first day, followed by a similar session on their amblyopic eye on the second day. Baseline steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) measurements were collected each day prior to patching, with post-patching SSVEPs measurements obtained immediately after the patching session. The experimental design incorporated a binocular rivalry paradigm, utilizing SSVEPs measurements.
RESULTS: The results revealed that inverse patching induced a heightened influence on neural plasticity, manifesting in a reduction of interocular suppression from the fellow eye to the amblyopic eye. In contrast, patching the fellow eye demonstrated negligible effects on the visual cortex. Furthermore, alterations in interocular suppression subsequent to inverse patching exhibited a correlation with the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye.
CONCLUSION: Inverse patching emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for adolescents and adults grappling with severe anisometropic amblyopia that proves refractory to conventional interventions. This innovative approach exhibits the potential to induce more robust neural plasticity within the visual cortex, thereby modulating neural interactions more effectively than traditional amblyopia treatments.},

@article{Du2023,
	abstract = {Training of viewing an altered-reality environment dichoptically has been found to reactivate human adult ocular dominance plasticity, allowing improvement of vision for amblyopia. One suspected mechanism for this training effect is ocular dominance rebalancing through interocular disinhibition. Here, we investigated whether the training modulated the neural responses reflecting interocular inhibition. Thirteen patients with amblyopia and 11 healthy controls participated in this study. Before and after six daily altered-reality training sessions, participants watched flickering video stimuli with their steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) signals recorded simultaneously. We assessed the amplitude of SSVEP response at intermodulation frequencies, which was a potential neural indicator of interocular suppression. The results showed that training weakened the intermodulation response only in the amblyopic group, which was in agreement with the hypothesis that the training reduced interocular suppression specific to amblyopia. Moreover, even one month after the training ended, we could still observe this neural training effect. These findings provide preliminary neural evidence in support of the disinhibition account for treating amblyopia. We also explain these results with the ocular opponency model, which, to our knowledge, is the first time for this binocular rivalry model to be used in explaining long-term ocular dominance plasticity.},

@article{Zheng2019,
	abstract = {In this study, we aimed to explore an objective, sensitive and quantitative measurement of interocular suppression in strabismic amblyopia. We compared 11 strabismic subjects with 12 normal vision subjects to explore the different response characterizations in normal eyes, nondominant and dominant eyes of strabismic subjects by using steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEPs). Stimulation at different temporal frequencies was presented to two eyes by using an interocular dichoptic technique. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and some statistical methods, such as the paired t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation analysis, were used to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We proposed two indices-divergence J and suppression imbalance (SI) to describe the deficits in interocular suppression-and one index - mask attenuation coefficient (MAC)- to describe the influence of a dichoptic mask from the dominant eyes to nondominant eyes of strabismic subjects. A significant difference was found between nondominant and dominant eyes of strabismic subjects in SSMVEP response and SNR value while no apparent difference was observed between the two eyes in subjects with normal vision. There was a strong linear correlation between divergence J, SI and visual acuity difference of two eyes both in strabismic amblyopia and normal vision. A linear correlation was also found between visual acuity difference and MAC in patients with strabismic amblyopia. Our findings suggest that SSMVEPs can be an objective and quantitative method for measuring the interocular suppression in strabismus and assessing the deficits of strabismic amblyopia.},

@article{Baker2015,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Visual deficits in amblyopia are neural in origin, yet are difficult to characterize with functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI). Our aim was to develop an objective electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm that can be used to provide a clinically useful index of amblyopic deficits.
METHODS: We used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to measure full contrast response functions in both amblyopic (n = 10, strabismic or mixed amblyopia, mean age: 44 years) and control (n = 5, mean age: 31 years) observers, both with and without a dichoptic mask.
RESULTS: At the highest target contrast, the ratio of amplitudes across the weaker and stronger eyes was highly correlated (r = 0.76) with the acuity ratio between the eyes. We also found that the contrast response function in the amblyopic eye had both a greatly reduced amplitude and a shallower slope, but that surprisingly dichoptic masking was weaker than in controls. The results were compared with the predictions of a computational model of amblyopia and suggest a modification to the model whereby excitatory (but not suppressive) signals are attenuated in the amblyopic eye.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that SSVEPs offer a sensitive and objective measure of the ocular imbalance in amblyopia and could be used to assess the efficacy of amblyopia therapies currently under development.},

@article{Shibata2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a number of studies reported different interictal findings between migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO), the pathophysiology of the visual aura in migraine remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the visual processing in patients who experience MA between attacks using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).
METHODS: SSVEPs to high (98%) and low (29%) contrast black and white checkerboard gratings with two spatial frequencies (0.5 and 2.0 cpd) at 5 and 10 Hz (10 and 20 reversal/s) were recorded binocularly from 10 patients with MA, 10 patients with MO between attacks and 20 healthy controls (HC). The SSVEPs were Fourier analyzed to obtain the amplitude and phase of the second (2F) and fourth (4F) harmonic response.
RESULTS: In the amplitude of 2F, at 0.5 cpd, there was significant increased amplitude in both MA and MO in comparison to HC at 5 Hz in high and low contrast. However, no significant differences were detected at 2.0 cpd in both 5 and 10 Hz in high and low contrast. In the amplitude of 4F, at 2.0 cpd, there was significant increased amplitude in MA in comparison to MO and HC at 10 Hz in high contrast. However, there were no significant differences at 0.5 cpd at both 5 and 10 Hz in high and low contrast. There were no significant phase differences between MA, MO, and HC.
CONCLUSION: The high amplitude of the SSVEPs suggests that interictally migraine patients have abnormal excitability in the primary visual cortex, and this change in excitability may exist, at least partially, in the visual association cortex in MA.},

@article{Morrone1982,
	abstract = {Simple and complex cells of striate cortex of anaesthetized and paralysed cats were stimulated with two superimposed one-dimensional grating stimuli of different orientations to investigate inhibitory effects of non-optimally oriented stimuli. We confirmed that a stimulus of orientation orthogonal to a cell's long axis significantly reduces the cell's discharge rate. Further experiments revealed the following. (i) The inhibition was typically stronger for simple than for complex cells. (ii) It is very broadly tuned for orientation, all orientations outside the cell's tuning band having a comparable inhibitory effect. (iii) Similarly, it is broadly tuned for spatial frequency. These last two results suggest that the inhibition arises not from a single cell but from a pool of cells. (iv) The pattern of the discharge of the inhibition in response to stimulation by phase-reversed sinusoidal gratings is consistent with the notion that the inhibition arises from complex cells. A second series of recordings of stimulation by visual noise patterns demonstrated how 'cross-orientation inhibition' prevents simple cells from responding to two-dimensional visual noise while allowing them to respond to comparable one-dimensional noise patterns. We suggest that this mechanism may serve to render simple cells selectively sensitive to one-dimensional stimuli, such as the contours or borders of visual objects.},

@article{Levitt2001,
	abstract = {It is now well appreciated that parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways exist in the monkey as in the cat, the species in which parallel visual pathways were first and most thoroughly documented. What remains unclear is precisely how many separate pathways pass through the parvo- and magnocellular divisions of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), what relationships-homologous or otherwise-these pathways have to the cat's X, Y, and W pathways, and whether these are affected by visual deprivation. To address these issues of classification and trans-species comparison, we used achromatic stimuli to obtain an extensive set of quantitative measurements of receptive field properties in the parvo- and magnocellular laminae of the LGN of nine macaque monkeys: four normally reared and five monocularly deprived of vision by lid suture near the time of birth. In agreement with previous studies, we find that on average magnocellular neurons differ from parvocellular neurons by having shorter response latencies to optic chiasm stimulation, greater sensitivity to luminance contrast, and better temporal resolution. Magnocellular laminae are also distinguished by containing neurons that summate luminance over their receptive fields nonlinearly (Y cells) and whose temporal response phases decrease with increasing stimulus contrast (indicative of a contrast gain control mechanism). We found little evidence for major differences between magno- and parvocellular neurons on the basis of most spatial parameters except that at any eccentricity, the neurons with the smallest receptive field centers tended to be parvocellular. All parameters were distributed unimodally and continuously through the parvo- and magnocellular populations, giving no indications of subpopulations within each division. Monocular deprivation led to clear anatomical effects: cells in deprived-eye laminae were pale and shrunken compared with those in nondeprived eye laminae, and Cat-301 immunoreactivity in deprived laminae was essentially uniformly abolished. However, deprivation had only subtle effects on the response properties of LGN neurons. Neurons driven by the deprived eye in both magno- and parvocellular laminae had lower nonlinearity indices (i.e., summed signals across their receptive fields more linearly) and were somewhat less responsive. In magnocellular laminae driven by the deprived eye, neuronal response latencies to stimulation of the optic chiasm were slightly shorter than those in the nondeprived laminae, and receptive field surrounds were a bit stronger. No other response parameters were affected by deprivation, and there was no evidence for loss of a specific cell class as in the cat.},

Rhodopsin has been measured by Rushton's method of reflexion densitometry in a retinal region 18 degrees temporal to the fovea, using a wavelength of measuring light (555 nm) so far into the long wave part of the spectrum that possible blue absorbing intermediates (e.g. transient orange) do not interfere.2. Rhodopsin was bleached by a strong light for 10 sec and then held steady by a weaker light. During a 10 sec bleach, no regeneration occurs and the rate of bleaching is proportional to the quantum catch. The proportionality constant is about 10(-7) (td sec)(-1).3. From 2, the rate of photolysis at equilibrium produced by the steady light was calculated. Since conditions were at equilibrium, photolysis matched regeneration. It was found that the rate of generation was proportional to the amount of pigment still bleached. The proportionality constant was about 0.0025 sec(-1).4. It was found by several different methods that the constant in 3 is the same in the light or dark and hence regeneration occurs independently of bleaching.5. Therefore, the results from bleaching and regeneration experiments can be combined to give the general equation [Formula: see text], where p is the fraction of rhodopsin, t is time in sec and I is the retinal illuminance.6. This equation describes the results of partial bleaching and regeneration experiments under a variety of different exposure intensities of moderately long (at least 10 min) exposure durations.7. The dark adaptation curve in a peripheral region of the rod monochromat's retina where there are few cones follows a simple exponential course over nearly 7 log(10) units. Rhodopsin regeneration and log threshold for this region are described by the same curve with a time constant of about 400 sec. Each log unit fal in threshold is accompanied by 0.835% increase in rhodopsin. This time constant is in agreement with Rushton's (1961) finding, but appreciably longer than that reported by Ripps & Weale (1969a).8. The Ripps & Weale result was, however, obtained by bleaching with a very short bright xenon flash (as they did). Under these conditions, blue absorbing intermediate(s) is (are) formed, the time constant of regeneration of rhodopsin is much faster than after long tungsten bleaches, and the kinetic equation is not valid.9. The general equation, together with the relation found in 7, successfully accounts for results previously published by others of the effect of duration and intensity of bleaching on the recovery of rod threshold in the dark, provided only that more than 5% of the rhodopsin was bleached at the beginning of dark adaptation.},

@article{Kuffler1957,
	abstract = {Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between -0.10 and -0.24, with a mean value of -0.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed.},

	abstract = {1. The activity of single units was recorded from the striate cortex (area 17) of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. Responses to stimuli moving at different velocities were examined. 2. Peak evoked firing frequency, rather than fotal evoked spikes, is used throughout as a measure of response. The former mea-ure gives curves of response vs. velocity that correlate well with curves of contrast sensitivity vs. velocity, wheras the latter does not. 3. Cortical receptive fields were classified according to the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel. Simple cells were found to prefer lower velocities (mean 2-2 deg sec-1) than complex cells( mean 18-8 deg sec-1). The response of simple cells to stimuli moving faster than 20 deg sec-1 is generally poor; complex cells usually discharge briskly to these speeds. 4. Cells classified as hypercomplex by the end-inhibition criterion were further chara-terized as type I or type II, according to the suggestion of Dreher (1972). Type I units are indistinguishable from simple cells in their velocity tuning, and type II units equally clearly resemble complex cells. These results are therefor consistent with Dreher's sbudivision. 5. Teh selectivity of cells for velocity is variable but can be quite marked. The average selectivities of simple and complex cells are not significantly different. There is an inverse correlation between preferred velocity and the sharpness of velocity selectivity for simple cells; no trend is apparent for other cell types. 6. No clear correlation is observed between the velocity preferances of units and their degree of direction selectivity, or receptive field arrangement. Simple cells with 'sustainef' temporal responses to flashed stimuli tend to prefer slower rates of movement than 'transient' ones, and to be less selective for velocity. 7. The results for different cortical cell-types are compared with the velocity tuning of X- and Y-cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To assess visual acuity (VA) objectively using visual evoked potentials (VEPs), avoiding subjective trace evaluation and providing an acuity estimate with associated confidence limits.
METHODS: 40 normal subjects and 24 patients (with corneal and retinal diseases, decimal VA range 0.15-1.1 (= 0.8(logMAR) to -0.04(logMAR))) participated in the study. Checkerboard stimuli with six check sizes covering 0.05-0.4 degrees (or 0.09-0.8 degrees for visual acuities below 0.35 (= 0.46(logMAR)) were presented in brief-onset mode (40 ms on, 93 ms off) at 7.5 Hz. In normal subjects, the stimuli were also optically degraded by frosted occluders resulting in a decimal VA range of 0.13-2.8 (= 0.9(logMAR) to -0.45(logMAR)). Altogether, 108 steady-state VEPs were recorded with a Laplacian montage (2xOz-(RO+LO)). Fourier analysis yielded the magnitude (A) at the stimulus frequency, and the average of the two neighboring frequencies as noise estimate (N). A and N determine the significance level p of the response, and from their ratio the non-noise-contaminated response (A*) can be calculated. Tuning curves were obtained by plotting A* vs the dominant spatial frequency of the corresponding checkerboard. A fully automatic algorithm used the significance level (p<5%) and A* to automatically select an appropriate region in the high spatial-frequency range on which a linear regression was performed, yielding a zero-amplitude extrapolated spatial frequency SF0. Subjective VA was obtained with the automated "Freiburg Acuity Test".
RESULTS: The brief-onset presentation evoked high VEP amplitudes; however, many tuning curves displayed the well-known "notch" at intermediate check sizes. The fully automated analysis algorithm succeeded in 107 of 108 cases and effectively ignored the notch, if present. The relation between logVA and log(SF0) was a constant factor throughout the range tested: logVA = log(SF0)/17.6 cpd. In more than 95% of all cases, the acuity predicted from SF0 coincided within a factor of two (up and down, or +/-0.3 logMAR) with subjective VA with a coefficient of correlation of 0.90.
CONCLUSION: The fully automated analysis avoided subjective problems in peak-trough assessment. The results provide quantitative limits to assess patients with possible malingering.},

@article{Hoffmann2017,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Objective assessment of visual acuity (VA) is possible with VEP methodology, but established with sufficient precision only for vision better than about 1.0 logMAR. We here explore whether this can be extended down to 2.0 logMAR, highly desirable for low-vision evaluations.
METHODS: Based on the stepwise sweep algorithm (Bach et al. in Br J Ophthalmol 92:396-403, 2008) VEPs to monocular steady-state brief onset pattern stimulation (7.5-Hz checkerboards, 40% contrast, 40 ms on, 93 ms off) were recorded for eight different check sizes, from 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ to 9.0$\,^{\circ}$, for two runs with three occipital electrodes in a Laplace-approximating montage. We examined 22 visually normal participants where acuity was reduced to ≈ 2.0 logMAR with frosted transparencies. With the established heuristic algorithm the "VEP acuity" was extracted and compared to psychophysical VA, both obtained at 57 cm distance.
RESULTS: In 20 of the 22 participants with artificially reduced acuity the automatic analysis indicated a valid result (1.80 logMAR on average) in at least one of the two runs. 95% test-retest limits of agreement on average were $\pm$ 0.09 logMAR for psychophysical, and $\pm$ 0.21 logMAR for VEP-derived acuity. For 15 participants we obtained results in both runs and averaged them. In 12 of these 15 the low-acuity results stayed within the 95% confidence interval ($\pm$ 0.3 logMAR) as established by Bach et al. (2008).
CONCLUSIONS: The fully automated analysis yielded good agreement of psychophysical and electrophysiological VAs in 12 of 15 cases (80%) in the low-vision range down to 2.0 logMAR. This encourages us to further pursue this methodology and assess its value in patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the implementation and outcome quality of the Freiburg Acuity VEP methodology (Bach et al. in Br J Ophthalmol 92:396-403, 2008) on the Diagnosys Espion Profile and E3 electrophysiology systems.
METHODS: We recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from both eyes of 24 participants, where visual acuity (VA) was either full or reduced with scatter foils to approximately 0.5 and 0.8 LogMAR, resulting in a total of 144 recordings. Behavioral VA was measured in each case under the same conditions using the Freiburg Acuity Test (FrACT); VEP-based acuity was assessed with the "heuristic algorithm," which automatically selects points for regression to zero amplitude.
RESULTS: Behavioral VA ranged from - 0.2 to 1.0 LogMAR. The fully automatic heuristic VEP algorithm resulted in 8 of 144 recordings (6%) that were scored as "no result." The other 136 recordings (94%) had an outcome of - 0.20 to 1.3 LogMAR (which corresponds to a range of 20/12.5-20/400, or 6/3.8-6/120, in Snellen ratios; or 1.6-0.1 in decimal acuity). The heuristic VEP algorithm agreed with the behavioral VA to within $\pm$ 0.31 LogMAR (95% limits of agreement), which is equivalent to approximately three lines on a VA chart.
CONCLUSIONS: The successful implementation of the Freiburg Acuity VEP "heuristic algorithm" on a commercial system makes this capability available to a wider group of users. The limits of agreement of $\pm$ 0.31 LogMAR are close to the original implementation at the University of Freiburg and we believe are clinically acceptable for a fully automatic, largely objective assessment of visual acuity.},

@article{Ridder2004,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The spatial frequency sweep visual evoked potential (sVEP) is used to rapidly determine visual acuity in children or non-responsive patients. Two techniques have been used to separate signal from noise: (1) the 95% confidence interval for the signal amplitude (95% CI) or (2) the amplitude of a Fourier frequency adjacent to 2x the signal frequency (DFT). The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a significant difference in acuity estimates with these techniques.
METHODS: Ten normal subjects (approximately 0.00 logMAR acuity) and 11 patients with decreased visual acuity took part in this project. Stimulus production and data analysis were done with an Enfant 4010 (Neuroscientific Corp). Standard VEP recording techniques were employed. The stimulus was a horizontal-oriented, sine wave grating that swept up the spatial frequency spectrum (contrast 80%, temporal reversal rate 7.5 Hz). Sweeps were repeated until the confidence intervals for the data were no longer decreasing. The Bailey Lovie logMAR chart was used to determine visual acuity. A line was fit to the high spatial frequency data using either the 95% CI or the DFT as the noise estimate. By using these linear equations, acuity estimates were obtained at 0, 1, and 2 microV signal amplitudes.
RESULTS: The average logMAR acuity for the subjects with normal acuity was -0.06 +/- 0.070 (SD). The sVEP acuity estimates were 0.08 +/- 0.098, 0.18 +/- 0.092, and 0.33 +/- 0.195 (0, 1, and 2 microV extrapolations) with the 95% CI used as noise and 0.07 +/- 0.100, 0.18 +/- 0.103, and 0.33 +/- 0.202 (0, 1, and 2 microV extrapolations) with the DFT used as noise. By using the average noise from the Fourier frequency as the extrapolation level, the acuity was 0.10 +/- 0.098 logMAR. The average logMAR acuity for the subjects with decreased visual acuity was 0.67 +/- 0.306 (SD). The sVEP acuity estimates were 0.53 +/- 0.175, 0.66 +/- 0.171, and 0.88 +/- 0.295 (0, 1, and 2 microV extrapolations) with the 95% CI used as noise and 0.53 +/- 0.179, 0.65 +/- 0.176, and 0.86 +/- 0.268 (0, 1, and 2 microV extrapolations) with the DFT used as noise. By using the average noise from the Fourier frequency as the extrapolation level, the acuity was 0.57 +/- 0.186 logMAR. No significant difference was found between the two acuity estimate techniques for all of the subjects (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0.16, F20 = 2.131). The sVEP estimates of acuity to the 0 microV and noise levels were not significantly different from the logMAR acuity (paired t-test, all p values > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the sVEP acuity does not depend on the noise estimation technique. In agreement with prior studies, the sVEP acuity underestimates the logMAR acuity in normally sighted individuals by about an octave.},

	abstract = {Visual contrast sensitivity is poor in newborn human infants, but improves rapidly to approach adult levels by 8 months of age. During this period, infant sensitivity can be limited by physical factors affecting photon capture, such as eye size and photoreceptor density. Here we show that infant visual sensitivity is also limited by high levels of noise in the neural transduction process. Using a non-invasive electrophysiological measurement and a visual noise titration technique, we have found that intrinsic neural noise in neonates is approximately nine times higher than in adults. As intrinsic neural noise decreases during infancy, contrast sensitivity improves proportionally, suggesting that neural noise places critical limits on contrast sensitivity throughout development. Moreover, contrast gain control, an inhibitory process that adjusts visual responses to changing stimulation, is in place and operating in infants as young as 6 weeks of age, in spite of high levels of neural noise and significant immaturities in contrast sensitivity. The contrast gain control that we observed in human neonates may serve as a building block for more complex forms of visual inhibition, which develop later in infancy.},

A variable contrast, spatially random 2-D noise test pattern was masked by the presence of a superimposed independent noise pattern presented at 0, 12 and 40% contrast. Frequency-tagged steady state visual evoked potentials were used to separately record responses to the test (5.14Hz) and the mask (7.2Hz). By incrementally increasing the test contrast we measured contrast response functions for each mask contrast. The unmasked contrast response functions were largely similar in shape across age, but peak amplitude was higher in the children. Masking shifted the contrast response function rightward on the contrast axis in both the adults and older children, elevating contrast thresholds by a similar factor across age. However, in younger children, masking resulted in a change in the slope of the contrast response function. These findings suggest that immaturity in the contrast normalization process persists until approximately 11years of age.},

	abstract = {Using the method of limits, we measured the development of spatial and temporal vision beginning at 4 years of age. Participants were adults, and children aged 4, 5, 6, and 7 years (n = 24 per age). Spatial vision was assessed with vertical sine-wave gratings, and temporal vision was assessed with an unpatterned luminance field sinusoidally modulated over time. Under these testing conditions, spatial contrast sensitivity at every frequency increased by at least 0.5 log units between 4 and 7 years of age, at which point it was adult-like. Grating acuity reached adult values at 6 years of age. Temporal vision was more mature: at 4 years of age temporal contrast sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies (20 and 30 Hz) and critical flicker fusion frequency were already adult-like. Sensitivity at lower temporal frequencies (5 and 10 Hz) increased by 0.25 log units after the age of 4 to reach adult levels at age 7. The results suggest that temporal vision matures more rapidly than spatial vision during childhood. Thus, spatial and temporal vision are likely mediated by different underlying neural mechanisms that mature at different rates.},

We are unable to find such orientation-selective responses in newborn human infants within the sensitivity of our method, but repeated longitudinal testing of individual infants shows that measurable responses emerge around 6 weeks of age.

	abstract = {The reliability of visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements of acuity was determined by estimating acuity for sinewave luminance gratings which were counterphase modulated at either 12 or 20 reversals/sec (rps). Gratings were swept in spatial frequency beyond the acuity limit and acuity was estimated from an extrapolation based on the last peak in the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function. Twenty-five infants ranging in age from 17 to 25 weeks were studied. Individual 10 sec sweeps resulted in records with a criterion response in 65-75% of trials. The reliability of acuities obtained from individual 10 sec sweeps was +/- 0.54 octaves at 95% confidence across 12 and 20 rps recording conditions (RMS error of +/- 0.27 octaves). The best acuity attained by each infant on either a single sweep, or on their vector average, was reliable to +/- 0.38 octaves at 95% confidence (RMS error of +/- 0.19 octaves) compared to a range of individual acuities of about 2 octaves. Much of the variability of sweep VEP acuity in cross-sectional samples of infants is therefore attributable to reliable individual differences rather than to measurement error. In testing individual infants our analysis indicates that choice of temporal frequency accounts for only 14% of the variation in acuity estimates within subjects.},

Sinusoidal gratings were reversed in contrast at 12 alternations per sec at a space-average luminance of 220 cd/m2. During 10 sec trials, either the contrast or the spatial frequency was increased in a series of 19 steps. Thresholds were estimated by extrapolation of the VEP response functions to zero amplitude. The contrast threshold at low spatial frequencies developed rapidly from 7% contrast at 2-3 weeks to an asymptote of 0.5% at 9 weeks. For adults, maximum sensitivity at low spatial frequencies was 0.32-0.22%. The sweep VEP estimate of grating acuity showed a gradual increase in spatial frequency with age, starting at 5 c/deg during the first month and reaching 16.3 c/deg at 8 months. The mean adult acuity was 31.9 c/deg. There appeared to be two phases in the development of contrast sensitivity and acuity. Between 4 and 9 weeks overall contrast sensitivity increased by a factor of 4-5 at all spatial frequencies. Beyond 9 weeks, contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequencies remained constant, while sensitivity increased systematically at higher spatial frequencies.},

@article{Lennie1993,
	abstract = {Luminance was introduced by the CIE as a photometric analog of radiance. This implies that an additive spectral-luminosity function characterizes the human observer. In practice, many different spectral-sensitivity functions characterize human vision, although few produce the additive spectral-luminosity function V (lambda), which is suitable for use in practical photometry. Methods that give rise to additive spectral-sensitivity functions that most resemble V (lambda) tend to have in common the use of spatial or temporal frequencies that will discriminate against signals from the short-wavelength-sensitive cone pathways or against signals in other chromatic pathways. Some of the difference among results obtained with different techniques seems to reflect the extent to which the methods can bring about changes in the state of chromatic adaptation, but it also seems likely that not all tasks tap the same postreceptoral mechanisms. Psychophysical evidence is equivocal regarding the nature of the postreceptoral mechanisms: some evidence suggests just three mechanisms, one of which has a spectral sensitivity that is like V (lambda); other evidence suggests the existence of multiple mechanisms with different spectral sensitivities. Physiological recordings from neurons in the macaque's visual pathway suggest that the properties of the magnocellular system may be sufficient to account for spectral-sensitivity functions measured with the techniques of heterochromatic flicker photometry, minimally distinct border, and critical flicker fusion. These are the psychophysical methods that yield spectral sensitivities that are most like V (lambda). Other methods of measuring spectral sensitivity seem more likely to depend on signals that travel through the parvocellular system.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effect of attention on the contrast response curves of steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to counter-phased sinusoidal gratings. The 1 cyc/deg gratings were modulated either in luminance or chromaticity (equiluminant red-green). The luminance grating counter-phased at 9 Hz (to favour activation of the magno-cellular system), and the chromatic grating at 2.5 Hz (to favour activation of the parvo-cellular system). Attention was directed towards the gratings (displayed in the left visual field) by requiring subjects to detect and respond to randomly occurring changes in contrast. In the control condition, attention towards the grating was minimised by requiring subjects to detect a target letter amongst distracters briefly flashed in the contra-lateral visual field. Attention increased VEP amplitudes for both luminance and chromatic stimuli, more so at high than at low contrasts, increasing the slope of the contrast amplitude curves (over the non-saturating range of contrasts). The estimates of contrast threshold from extrapolation of amplitudes were unaffected by attention. Attention also changed the VEP phases, but only for luminance gratings, where it acted to reduce the magnitude of phase advance with contrast. Attention had no effect on the average phases for chromatic gratings. The results are consistent with the notion that attention acts on cortical gain control mechanisms, which are known to be different for the magno- and parvo-cellular systems.},

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and time-domain analysis were used to reveal differences in harmonic content and amplitude of chromatic and achromatic response components over a wide range of temporal frequencies. The chromatic ON/OFF VEP is dominated by the fundamental component indicating that onset and offset responses are different. This type of response is typical of neurons with sustained type response characteristics. Conversely, the achromatic onset VEP contains a predominant second harmonic component in addition to the fundamental. This similarity between onset and offset responses suggests that transient mechanisms are responsible for the generation of achromatic components. Frequency analysis of VEPs elicited by phase-reversing stimuli reveals that all of the response energy is concentrated at the second harmonic of the stimulating frequency. The magnitude of the second harmonic component is maximal for achromatic stimuli and undergoes a distinct minimum for isoluminant, chromatic stimuli. This behavior indicates that under the stimulus conditions used, magnocellular neurons with transient characteristics dominate the reversal VEP.},

	abstract = {Visual mechanisms in primary visual cortex are suppressed by the superposition of gratings perpendicular to their preferred orientations. A clear picture of this process is needed to (i) inform functional architecture of image-processing models, (ii) identify the pathways available to support binocular rivalry, and (iii) generally advance our understanding of early vision. Here we use monoptic sine-wave gratings and cross-orientation masking (XOM) to reveal two cross-oriented suppressive pathways in humans, both of which occur before full binocular summation of signals. One is a within-eye (ipsiocular) pathway that is spatially broadband, immune to contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that tends to decrease with stimulus duration. The other pathway operates between the eyes (interocular), is spatially tuned, desensitizes with contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that increases with stimulus duration. When cross-oriented masks are presented to both eyes, masking is enhanced or diminished for conditions in which either ipsiocular or interocular pathways dominate masking, respectively. We propose that ipsiocular suppression precedes the influence of interocular suppression and tentatively associate the two effects with the lateral geniculate nucleus (or retina) and the visual cortex respectively. The interocular route is a good candidate for the initial pathway involved in binocular rivalry and predicts that interocular cross-orientation suppression should be found in cortical cells with predominantly ipsiocular drive.},

	abstract = {Most cortical visual neurons do not respond linearly with contrast. Generally, they show saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast, a feature often characterized by a divisive normalization function. This nonlinearity is generally thought to be useful in focusing the dynamic response range of the neuron on a particular region of contrast space, optimizing contrast gain. Some neurons not only saturate but also supersaturate; at high contrast, the response of the neuron decreases rather than plateaus. Under the contrast gain control theory, these cells would seem to reflect a nonoptimal normalization pool that provides excessive inhibition to the neurons. Since very few data on supersaturation are available, this article examines the frequency with which such neurons occur in macaque visual cortex by considering an extension of the Naka-Rushton equation with the capacity to represent nonmonotonic functions. The prevalence of gain-control theories for saturation has occluded an additional computational function for saturation, namely, in detecting the conjunction of certain features. A saturating nonlinearity is a critical part of the selective detection of compound stimuli over their components. In this role, the existence of saturating contrast response functions might be considered necessary rather than simply optimal.},

@article{Carandini1998,
	abstract = {The responsiveness of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) is substantially reduced after a few seconds of visual stimulation with an effective pattern. This phenomenon, called pattern adaptation, is uniquely cortical and is the likely substrate of a variety of perceptual after-effects. While adaptation to a given pattern reduces the responses of V1 neurons to all subsequently viewed test patterns, this reduction shows some specificity, being strongest when the adapting and test patterns are identical. This specificity may indicate that adaptation affects the interaction between groups of neurons that are jointly activated by the adapting stimulus. We investigated this possibility by studying the effects of adaptation to visual patterns containing one or both of two orientations--the preferred orientation for a cell, and the orientation orthogonal to it. Because neurons in the primary visual cortex are sharply tuned for orientation, stimulation with orthogonal orientations excites two largely distinct populations of neurons. With intracellular recordings of the membrane potential of cat V1 neurons, we found that adaptation to the orthogonal orientation alone does not evoke the hyperpolarization that is typical of adaptation to the preferred orientation. With extracellular recordings of the firing rate of macaque V1 neurons, we found that the responses were not reduced by adaptation to the orthogonal orientation alone nearly as much as by adaptation to the preferred orientation. In the macaque we also studied the effects of adaptation to plaids containing both the preferred and the orthogonal orientations. We found that adaptation to these stimuli could modify the interactions between orientations. It increased the amount of cross-orientation suppression displayed by some cells, even turning some cells that showed cross-orientation facilitation when adapted to a blank stimulus into cells that show cross-orientation suppression. This result suggests that pattern adaptation can affect the interaction between the groups of neurons tuned to the orthogonal orientations, either by increasing their mutual inhibition or by decreasing their mutual excitation.},

According to the model, simple cells compute a linear sum of the responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. In addition, each simple cell's linear response is divided by the pooled activity of a large number of other simple cells. The cell membrane performs both operations; synaptic currents are summed and then divided by the total membrane conductance. Current and conductance are decoupled (by a complementary arrangement of excitation and inhibition) so that current depends only on the LGN inputs and conductance depends only on the cortical inputs. Closed form expressions were derived for fitting and interpreting physiological data. The model accurately predicted responses to drifting grating stimuli of various contrasts, orientations, and spatiotemporal frequencies.},

	abstract = {How do neuronal populations represent concurrent stimuli? We measured population responses in cat primary visual cortex (V1) using electrode arrays. Population responses to two superimposed gratings were weighted sums of the individual grating responses. The weights depended strongly on the relative contrasts of the gratings. When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas.},

Most neurones showed a clear threshold contrast below which no response was elicited. Such thresholds presumably contribute to the animal's behavioural threshold, which should not be accounted for solely in terms of the detection of a signal in the presence of spontaneous "noise". Above threshold, the response amplitude usually increased linearly with contrast until it began to saturate at the highest contrasts. The variance of the response increased with its amplitude; this finding perhaps underlies the Weber-Fechner relation for psychophysical contrast discrimination.},

	abstract = {1. Second-order frequency responses were obtained from cat retinal ganglion cells of the Y type. The cells were stimulated by a spatial sine grating whose contrast was modulated in time by a sum of eight sinusoids. 2. Second-order frequency responses obtained at higher contrasts have a peak amplitude at higher input temporal frequency, and phase shifts, compared to their low-contrast counterparts. 3. This change in shape of the second-order frequency response is a departure from the prediction of the linear/static non-linear/linear sandwich model of the non-linear pathway in the cat retina. The departure is analysed by means of the hypothesis that the two filters of the sandwich model are parametric in contrast. 4. Most of the change in shape of the second-order frequency response with contrast is accounted for in terms of the sandwich model by changes in the transfer characteristics of the filter preceding the static non-linearity. 5. The effect of contrast on the second-order responses of Y cells is qualitatively similar in several ways to the effect of contrast on first-order responses. This suggests that the contrast gain control mechanism acts early in the retina, before linear and non-linear pathways have diverged.},

However, increasing the size of a high-contrast pattern makes it more difficult for observers to discriminate motion. This surprising result, termed spatial suppression, is thought to be mediated by a form of center-surround suppression found throughout the visual pathway. Here, we examine the counterintuitive hypothesis that aging alters such center-surround interactions in ways that improve performance in some tasks. We found that older observers required briefer stimulus durations than did younger observers to extract information about stimulus direction in conditions using large, high-contrast patterns. We suggest that this age-related improvement in motion discrimination may be linked to reduced GABAergic functioning in the senescent brain, which reduces center-surround suppression in motion-selective neurons.},

We show that human contrast sensitivity is similarly affected by two distinct suppression mechanisms. In agreement with the animal studies, human surround suppression is tightly tuned to the orientation and spatial frequency of the test, unlike overlay suppression. Using a double-masking paradigm, we also show that in humans, overlay suppression precedes surround suppression in the processing sequence. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike overlay suppression, surround suppression is only strong in the periphery (> 1 degree eccentricity).

	abstract = {Centre-surround receptive field organization is a ubiquitous property in mammalian visual systems, presumably tailored for extracting image features that are differentially distributed over space. In visual motion, this is evident as antagonistic interactions between centre and surround regions of the receptive fields of many direction-selective neurons in visual cortex. In a series of psychophysical experiments we make the counterintuitive observation that increasing the size of a high-contrast moving pattern renders its direction of motion more difficult to perceive and reduces its effectiveness as an adaptation stimulus. We propose that this is a perceptual correlate of centre-surround antagonism, possibly within a population of neurons in the middle temporal visual area. The spatial antagonism of motion signals observed at high contrast gives way to spatial summation as contrast decreases. Evidently, integration of motion signals over space depends crucially on the visibility of those signals, thereby allowing the visual system to register motion information efficiently and adaptively.},

Vorobyov, 2005) there are at least two routes to cross-orientation suppression (XOS): a broadband, non-adaptable, monocular (within-eye) pathway and a more narrowband, adaptable interocular (between the eyes) pathway. We further characterized these two routes psychophysically by measuring the weight of suppression across spatio-temporal frequency for cross-oriented pairs of superimposed flickering Gabor patches. Masking functions were normalized to unmasked detection thresholds and fitted by a two-stage model of contrast gain control (T. S. Meese, M. A. Georgeson, & D. H. Baker, 2006) that was developed to accommodate XOS. The weight of monocular suppression was a power function of the scalar quantity 'speed' (temporal-frequency/spatial-frequency). This weight can be expressed as the ratio of non-oriented magno- and parvo-like mechanisms, permitting a fast-acting, early locus, as benefits the urgency for action associated with high retinal speeds. In contrast, dichoptic-masking functions superimposed. Overall, this (i) provides further evidence for dissociation between the two forms of XOS in humans, and (ii) indicates that the monocular and interocular varieties of XOS are space/time scale-dependent and scale-invariant, respectively. This suggests an image-processing role for interocular XOS that is tailored to natural image statistics-very different from that of the scale-dependent (speed-dependent) monocular variety.},

Thresholds were obtained for sinewave grating stimulation of the right eye in the presence of simultaneous masking gratings presented to the right eye (monocular masking) or left eye (dichoptic masking). In the first experiment, thresholds were measured at 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, and 16.0 cycle per degree (cpd) as a function of the contrast of masking gratings of identical frequency and phase. Thresholds rose nonmonotonically with masking contrast. At medium and high contrast levels, dichoptic masking was more effective in elevating contrast thresholds than monocular masking, and approached Weber's Law behavior. In the second experiment, spatial frequency tuning functions were obtained for test gratings at five spatial frequencies, by measuring threshold elevation as a function of the spatial frequency of constant-contrast masking gratings. At 1.0, 4.0, and 16.0 cpd, the tuning functions peaked at the test frequencies. The dichoptic tuning functions had a bandwidth of about 1 octave between half-maximum points, narrower than +/- 1 octave bandwidths of the monocular tuning functions. At 0.125 and 0.25 cpd, the tuning functions were broader and exhibited a shift in peak masking to frequencies above the test frequencies.},

This study is concerned with chromoluminance patterns, that is, patterns that vary over space in luminance, chromaticity, or both. Contrast thresholds for 1 c/deg Gabor patterns (targets) were measured as a function of the contrast of Gabor pedestal patterns (TvC functions), where the pedestals paired with each target were modulated in a wide range of directions in color space. For most target-pedestal pairs, the TvC function decreased (facilitation) and then increased as pedestal contrast increased. The increase went above the absolute contrast threshold (masking) for all target-pedestal pairs except in cases where facilitation occurred at the upper end of the pedestal contrast range. The specific form of the TvC function varied greatly with the target and pedestal, consistent with a general model of pedestal effects proposed by Foley [Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 1994, 11(6)]. There were two sets of target-pedestal pairs for which facilitation did not occur, but masking did occur: pairs in which the target was a luminance modulation and the pedestals were individually isoluminant and pairs in which the pedestal was blue/yellow and the target was in any of our directions except blue/yellow.},

A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

Complex cells have been depicted as energy mechanisms, constructed from the squared sum of the outputs of quadrature pairs of linear operators. However, the linear/energy model falls short of a complete explanation of striate cell responses. In this paper, a modified version of the linear/energy model is presented in which striate cells mutually inhibit one another, effectively normalizing their responses with respect to stimulus contrast. This paper reviews experimental measurements of striate cell responses, and shows that the new model explains a significantly larger body of physiological data.},

@article{Derrington1984,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the analysis of the chromatic properties of neurones, and applies it to cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) of macaque. The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a 'constant B' axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue-sensitive (B) cones, a 'constant R & G' axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red-sensitive (R) or green-sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the 'constant B' and 'constant R & G' axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0-180 deg, and the constant R & G axis the azimuth 90-270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (-90 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this 'null plane' provides the 'signature' of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R-G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Di-Russo2007,
	abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the neural generators of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to repetitive, 6 Hz pattern-reversal stimulation. Multichannel scalp recordings of SSVEPs and dipole modeling techniques were combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and retinotopic mapping in order to estimate the locations of the cortical sources giving rise to the SSVEP elicited by pattern reversal. The time-varying SSVEP scalp topography indicated contributions from two major cortical sources, which were localized in the medial occipital and mid-temporal regions of the contralateral hemisphere. Colocalization of dipole locations with fMRI activation sites indicated that these two major sources of the SSVEP were located in primary visual cortex (V1) and in the motion sensitive (MT/V5) areas, respectively. Minor contributions from mid-occipital (V3A) and ventral occipital (V4/V8) areas were also considered. Comparison of SSVEP phase information with timing information collected in a previous transient VEP study (Di Russo et al. [2005] Neuroimage 24:874-886) suggested that the sequence of cortical activation is similar for steady-state and transient stimulation. These results provide a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the cortical origins of the SSVEP, which should enhance its use as an efficient clinical tool for evaluating visual-cortical dysfunction as well as an investigative probe of the cortical mechanisms of visual-perceptual processing.},

@article{Regan1988,
	abstract = {Response asymmetry (e.g. to light ON vs. OFF), a frequently encountered property of neurons at both peripheral and central levels in sensory pathways, can be modelled as a rectifier. When fed with the sum of two sinusoids of frequencies F1 and F2 Hz, the output of a rectifier contains multiple discrete frequency components of frequency (nF1 $\pm$ mF2) where n and m are zero or integers. We describe a double Fourier series method for obtaining the amplitudes and phases of these components for physiologically relevant neural models including (1) compressive, linear, accelerating and mixed compressive/accelerating single model neurons, (2) a cascaded series of model neurons and (3) the parallel/cascaded case corresponding to dichoptic or dichotic stimulation. If one of the inputs is held constant while the other's amplitude is varied, we obtain a family of curves---one for each (nF1 $\pm$ mF2) component. The family of curves seems to be characteristic of the particular non-linear system. Neural models may be tested by first calculating the family of curves and then comparing these theoretical data with a physiologically measured family of curves. Illustrating this approach, we compare the predictions of case (1) and case (2) models with the family of curves obtained by stimulating with F1 Hz flicker of fixed modulation depth superimposed on F2 Hz flicker of variable modulation depth. Evoked brain responses were analysed by non-destructive zoom-FFT giving resolution up to the Heisenberg-Gabor limit of ΔF = ΔT−1, where ΔT is the recording duration. Thus, for example, the spectrum could contain 50 000 lines over a D.C.-100 Hz bandwidth for a 500 second recording duration. Empirically, the bandwidth of discrete physiological components is no more than 0·004 Hz. Like the Wiener kernel time-domain approach, this frequency-domain approach is restricted to time-invariant systems with a limited settling time and without appreciable hysteresis. On the other hand, the Weiner kernel approach seems to handle dynamic systems more conveniently. But this frequency-domain method has the important advantage that different signal components are well separated from each other and from noise, whereas signal and noise overlap in the time domain. Consequently, high-order terms are more easily recorded using the frequency domain method, thus giving sharper distinctions between candidate non-linear models.},

@article{Benjamin2018,
	abstract = {Most of our knowledge about vision comes from experiments in which stimuli are presented to immobile human subjects or animals. In the case of human subjects, movement during psychophysical, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging experiments is considered to be a source of noise to be eliminated. Animals used in visual neuroscience experiments are typically restrained and, in many cases, anesthetized. In reality, however, vision is often used to guide the motion of awake, ambulating organisms. Recent work in mice has shown that locomotion elevates visual neuronal response amplitudes (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Erisken et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Mineault et al., 2016) and reduces long-range gain control (Ayaz et al., 2013). Here, we used both psychophysics and steady-state electrophysiology to investigate whether similar effects of locomotion on early visual processing can be measured in humans. Our psychophysical results show that brisk walking has little effect on subjects' ability to detect briefly presented contrast changes and that co-oriented flankers are, if anything, more effective masks when subjects are walking. Our electrophysiological data were consistent with the psychophysics indicating no increase in stimulus-driven neuronal responses while walking and no reduction in surround suppression. In summary, we have found evidence that early contrast processing is altered by locomotion in humans but in a manner that differs from that reported in mice. The effects of locomotion on very low-level visual processing may differ on a species-by-species basis and may reflect important differences in the levels of arousal associated with locomotion.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mice are the current model of choice for studying low-level visual processing. Recent studies have shown that mouse visual cortex is modulated by behavioral state: primary visual cortex neurons in locomoting mice tend to be more sensitive and less influenced by long-range gain control. Here, we tested these effects in humans by measuring psychophysical detection thresholds and electroencephalography (EEG) responses while subjects walked on a treadmill. We found no evidence of increased contrast sensitivity or reduced surround suppression in walking humans. Our data show that fundamental measurements of early visual processing differ between humans and mice and this has important implications for recent work on the links among arousal, behavior, and vision in these two species.},

	abstract = {Cortical gain regulation allows neurons to respond adaptively to changing inputs. Neural gain is modulated by internal and external influences, including attentional and arousal states, motor activity and neuromodulatory input. These influences converge to a common set of mechanisms for gain modulation, including GABAergic inhibition, synaptically driven fluctuations in membrane potential, changes in cellular conductance and changes in other biophysical neural properties. Recent work has identified GABAergic interneurons as targets of neuromodulatory input and mediators of state-dependent gain modulation. Here, we review the engagement and effects of gain modulation in the cortex. We highlight key recent findings that link phenomenological observations of gain modulation to underlying cellular and circuit-level mechanisms. Finally, we place these cellular and circuit interactions in the larger context of their impact on perception and cognition.},

@article{Norcia1989,
	abstract = {Contrast response functions (CRFs) for the VEP were obtained with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) technique employing swept contrast gratings. VEP CRFs in infants were found to have a form similar to those observed in adults, being linear functions of log contrast over a range of nearthreshold contrasts. CRFs with low and high contrast lobes were present in infants, as they are in adults. Contrast thresholds were estimated by extrapolation of the CRF to zero microvolts. The effects of additive EEG noise and of the DFT data window on the shape of the measured CRF are considered. For large signals, the measured CRF is nearly independent of the additive noise, but at small signal values additive noise introduces a small bias towards larger amplitudes. The VEP signal-plus-noise distribution was modeled as a family of Rice distributions in order to evaluate the effects of bias on the estimates of threshold. The amount of bias depends inversely upon the slope of the CRF. The amount of bias introduced by a smoothing window also depends upon slope of the CRF as well as the sweep rate. The combined effects of additive noise and window bias were such that the total bias was nearly independent of CRF slope. Sweep VEP contrast thresholds were shown empirically to be unaffected by changes in the range of contrast swept.},

Decades of electrophysiological measurements in non-human primates as well as human EEG and fMRI studies have shown that spatial attention modulates firing rates across the visual cortex, but the computations that drive this process are still unclear. Further, while it is well known that attention affects perception, we have only a limited understanding of the link between attentionally driven changes in neural firing rates and subject performance. Here we used a novel human neuroimaging method to measure the effect of spatial attention on neural responses in V1, hMT+, hV4, and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Attention altered signals in different ways across the visual cortex: areas V1, hMT+, and IPS exhibited primarily response gain changes while hV4 showed contrast gain modulation. Signals in V1, hMT+, and IPS correlated with contrast detection performance suggesting that behavior can be predicted by population-level signals as early as striate cortex.},

	abstract = {Neural signals driven by short-wave-sensitive (S) cones are, to a large degree, anatomically and functionally separate from the achromatic luminance pathway until at least one synapse into V1. Attentional mechanisms that act at an anatomically early stage in V1 may, therefore, affect S-cone and luminance signals differently. Here, we used a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm combined with electrical source imaging to study the effects of contrast and attention on neural responses to both chromatic S-cone isolating and achromatic stimuli in five human visual areas including V1. The responses to these gratings were affected very differently by changes in contrast and attention. Increasing cone contrast increased the response amplitude for both types of stimulus. For the S-cone-defined stimuli, we also observed a systematic decrease in the response phase of the first harmonic with increasing stimulus contrast, but there was no corresponding change in phase for the first harmonic of the luminance probes. Attending to the contrast of the grating increased the amplitude and phase of luminance-driven responses but had no effect on S-cone-driven responses. We conclude that while attentional modulation can be observed in achromatic pathways as early as V1, attention may not affect SSVEP signals generated by S-cone stimuli.},

@article{Xiao2010,
	abstract = {Cortical responses to spatially discrete patches of achromatic luminance contrast can be altered by the presence of high-contrast, spatially remote ``surrounds'' and this achromatic ``surround suppression'' has been the subject of much recent research. However, the nature of long-range contrast normalization in chromatic signals has been less studied. Here we use a combination of neuroimaging data from source-imaged EEG and two different psychophysical measures of surround suppression to study contrast normalization in stimuli containing achromatic luminance and S-cone-isolating contrast. In an appearance matching task, we find strong within-channel but little between-channel suppression. However, using a contrast increment detection task, we do find evidence for weak but significant between-channel effects. Our neural measurements agree with the appearance matching data, showing significant within-channel suppression and no significant interactions between signals initiated in different pre-cortical pathways. We hypothesize that appearance judgments and V1 population responses are dominated by neurons with chromatically matched classical and extra-classical surrounds while contrast increment detection tasks rely on a subpopulation of neurons that have extra-classical surrounds sensitive to both chromatic and achromatic contrasts. Our psychophysical and source-imaged EEG results are consistent with a hypothesis based on natural scene statistics that long-range contrast normalization in early visual system is largely driven by signals within the same chromatic channel.},

@article{Baker2021,
	abstract = {In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.},

@article{Lygo2021,
	abstract = {Even after conventional patching treatment, individuals with a history of amblyopia typically lack good stereo vision. This is often attributed to atypical suppression between the eyes, yet the specific mechanism is still unclear. Guided by computational models of binocular vision, we tested explicit predictions about how neural responses to contrast might differ in individuals with impaired binocular vision. Participants with a history of amblyopia (N = 25), and control participants with typical visual development (N = 19) took part in the study. Neural responses to different combinations of contrast in the left and right eyes, were measured using both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Stimuli were sinusoidal gratings with a spatial frequency of 3c/deg, flickering at 4 Hz. In the fMRI experiment, we also ran population receptive field and retinotopic mapping sequences, and a phase-encoded localiser stimulus, to identify voxels in primary visual cortex (V1) sensitive to the main stimulus. Neural responses in both modalities increased monotonically with stimulus contrast. When measured with EEG, responses were attenuated in the weaker eye, consistent with a fixed tonic suppression of that eye. When measured with fMRI, a low contrast stimulus in the weaker eye substantially reduced the response to a high contrast stimulus in the stronger eye. This effect was stronger than when the stimulus-eye pairings were reversed, consistent with unbalanced dynamic suppression between the eyes. Measuring neural responses using different methods leads to different conclusions about visual differences in individuals with impaired binocular vision. Both of the atypical suppression effects may relate to binocular perceptual deficits, e.g. in stereopsis, and we anticipate that these measures could be informative for monitoring the progress of treatments aimed at recovering binocular vision.},

However, current animal behaviour paradigms rarely match the social and cognitive behaviours exhibited by autistic individuals. Here, we instead assay another functional domain-sensory processing-known to be affected in autism to test a novel genetic autism model in Drosophila melanogaster. We show similar visual response alterations and a similar development trajectory in Nhe3 mutant flies (total n = 72) and in autistic human participants (total n = 154). We report a dissociation between first- and second-order electrophysiological visual responses to steady-state stimulation in adult mutant fruit flies that is strikingly similar to the response pattern in human adults with ASD as well as that of a large sample of neurotypical individuals with high numbers of autistic traits. We explain this as a genetically driven, selective signalling alteration in transient visual dynamics. In contrast to adults, autistic children show a decrease in the first-order response that is matched by the fruit fly model, suggesting that a compensatory change in processing occurs during development. Our results provide the first animal model of autism comprising a differential developmental phenotype in visual processing.},

We tested several computational models against data from steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) experiments in humans, using periodic visual stimuli combined across either retinal location or eye-of-presentation. A model in which signals are raised to an exponent before being summed in both the numerator and the denominator of a gain control nonlinearity gave the best account of the data. This model also predicted the pattern of responses in a range of additional conditions accurately and with no free parameters, as well as predicting responses at harmonic and intermodulation frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz. We speculate that this model implements the optimal algorithm for combining multiple noisy inputs, in which responses are proportional to the weighted sum of both inputs. This suggests a novel purpose for cortical gain control: implementing optimal signal combination via mutual inhibition, perhaps explaining its ubiquity as a neural computation.},

For fundamental attributes, such as stimulus contrast, this involves one or more nonlinearities that are believed to optimise the neural code to represent features of the natural environment. Here we ask if the same is also true of more complex stimulus dimensions, such as emotional facial expression. We report the results of three experiments combining morphed facial stimuli with electrophysiological and psychophysical methods to measure the function mapping emotional expression intensity to internal response. The results converge on a nonlinearity that accelerates over weak expressions, and then becomes shallower for stronger expressions, similar to the situation for lower level stimulus properties. We further demonstrate that the nonlinearity is not attributable to the morphing procedure used in stimulus generation.},

	abstract = {A neutral density filter placed before one eye will produce a dichoptic imbalance in luminance, which attenuates responses to visual stimuli and lags neural signals from retina to cortex in the filtered eye. When stimuli are presented to both the filtered and unfiltered eye (i.e., binocularly), neural responses show little attenuation and no lag compared with their baseline counterpart. This suggests that binocular visual mechanisms must suppress the attenuated and delayed input from the filtered eye; however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we used a Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) technique to measure neural responses to monocularly and binocularly presented stimuli while observers wore an ND filter in front of their dominant eye. These data were well-described by a binocular summation model, which received the sinusoidal contrast modulation of the stimulus as input. We incorporated the influence of the ND filter with an impulse response function, which adjusted the input magnitude and phase in a biophysically plausible manner. The model captured the increase in attenuation and lag of neural signals for stimuli presented to the filtered eye as a function of filter strength, while also generating the filter phase-invariant responses from binocular presentation for EEG and psychophysical data. These results clarify how binocular visual mechanisms-specifically interocular suppression-can suppress the delayed and attenuated signals from the filtered eye and maintain normal neural signals under imbalanced luminance conditions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Several recent studies have demonstrated that following short-term monocular deprivation in normal adults, the patched eye, rather than the unpatched eye, becomes stronger in subsequent binocular viewing. However, little is known about the site and nature of the underlying processes. In this study, we examine the underlying mechanisms by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as an index of the neural contrast response in early visual areas.
METHODS: The experiment consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-patching EEG recording (14 minutes), a monocular patching stage (2.5 hours) and a post-patching EEG recording (14 minutes; started immediately after the removal of the patch). During the patching stage, a diffuser (transmits light but not pattern) was placed in front of one randomly selected eye. During the EEG recording stage, contrast response functions for each eye were measured.
RESULTS: The neural responses from the patched eye increased after the removal of the patch, whilst the responses from the unpatched eye remained the same. Such phenomena occurred under both monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret this eye dominance plasticity in adult human visual cortex as homeostatic intrinsic plasticity regulated by an increase of contrast-gain in the patched eye.},

	abstract = {Photoreceptors are light-sensitive cells in the retina converting visual stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are evaluated and interpreted in the visual pathway, a process referred to as visual processing. Phosphodiesterase type 5 and 6 (PDE5 and 6) are abundant enzymes in retinal vessels and notably photoreceptors where PDE6 is exclusively present. The effects of the PDE inhibitor sildenafil on the visual system, have been studied using electroretinography and a variety of clinical visual tasks. Here we evaluate effects of sildenafil administration by electrophysiological recordings of flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from key regions in the rodent visual pathway. Progressive changes were investigated in female Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 timepoints from 30 min to 28 h after peroral administration of sildenafil (50 mg/kg). Sildenafil caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of VEPs in both visual cortex and superior colliculus, and a significant delay of the VEPs as demonstrated by increased latency of several VEP peaks. Also, sildenafil-treatment significantly reduced the signal-to-noise ratio of SSVEPs. The effects of sildenafil were dependent on the wavelength condition in both assays. Our results support the observation that while PDE6 is a key player in phototransduction, near full inhibition of PDE6 is not enough to abolish the complex process of visual processing. Taken together, VEPs and SSVEPs are effective in demonstrating progressive effects of drug-induced changes in visual processing in rats and as the same paradigms may be applied in humans, representing a promising tool for translational research.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers suitable for early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression are the cornerstone of developing disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides motor complications, PD is also characterized by deficits in visual processing. Here, we investigate how virally-mediated overexpression of α-synuclein in the substantia nigra pars compacta impacts visual processing in a well-established rodent model of PD. After a unilateral injection of vector, human α-synuclein was detected in the striatum and superior colliculus (SC). In parallel, there was a significant delay in the latency of the transient VEPs from the affected side of the SC in late stages of the disease. Inhibition of leucine-rich repeat kinase using PFE360 failed to rescue the VEP delay and instead increased the latency of the VEP waveform. A support vector machine classifier accurately classified rats according to their `disease state' using frequency-domain data from steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Overall, these findings indicate that the latency of the rodent VEP is sensitive to changes mediated by the increased expression of α-synuclein and especially when full overexpression is obtained, whereas the SSVEP facilitated detection of α-synuclein across reflects all stages of PD model progression.},

@article{Himmelberg2018,
	abstract = {The excitotoxic theory of Parkinson's disease (PD) hypothesizes that a pathophysiological degeneration of dopaminergic neurons stems from neural hyperactivity at early stages of disease, leading to mitochondrial stress and cell death. Recent research has harnessed the visual system of Drosophila PD models to probe this hypothesis. Here, we investigate whether abnormal visual sensitivity and excitotoxicity occur in early-onset PD (EOPD) Drosophila models DJ-1αΔ72, DJ-1βΔ 93, and PINK15. We used an electroretinogram to record steady-state visually evoked potentials driven by temporal contrast stimuli. At 1 day of age, all EOPD mutants had a twofold increase in response amplitudes compared with w̄ controls. Furthermore, we found that excitotoxicity occurs in older EOPD models after increased neural activity is triggered by visual stimulation. In an additional analysis, we used a linear discriminant analysis to test whether there were subtle variations in neural gain control that could be used to classify Drosophila into their correct age and genotype. The discriminant analysis was highly accurate, classifying Drosophila into their correct genotypic class at all age groups at 50-70\% accuracy (20\% chance baseline). Differences in cellular processes link to subtle alterations in neural network operation in young flies, all of which lead to the same pathogenic outcome. Our data are the first to quantify abnormal gain control and excitotoxicity in EOPD Drosophila mutants. We conclude that EOPD mutations may be linked to more sensitive neuronal signaling in prodromal animals that may cause the expression of PD symptomologies later in life. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Steady-state visually evoked potential response amplitudes to multivariate temporal contrast stimuli were recorded in early-onset PD Drosophila models. Our data indicate that abnormal gain control and a subsequent visual loss occur in these PD mutants, supporting a broader excitotoxicity hypothesis in genetic PD. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis could accurately classify Drosophila into their correct genotype at different ages throughout their lifespan. Our results suggest increased neural signaling in prodromal PD patients.},

@article{Nippe2017,
	abstract = {An organism's biological day is characterized by a pattern of anticipatory physiological and behavioral changes that are governed by circadian clocks to align with the 24-h cycling environment. Here, we used flash electroretinograms (ERGs) and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to examine how visual responsiveness in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and the circadian clock mutant ClkJrk varies over circadian time. We show that the ERG parameters of wild-type flies vary over the circadian day, with a higher luminance response during the subjective night. The SSVEP response that assesses contrast sensitivity also showed a time-of-day dependence, including 2 prominent peaks within a 24-h period and a maximal response at the end of the subjective day, indicating a tradeoff between luminance and contrast sensitivity. Moreover, the behaviorally arrhythmic ClkJrk mutants maintained a circadian profile in both luminance and contrast sensitivity, but unlike the wild-types, which show bimodal profiles in their visual response, ClkJrk flies show a weakening of the bimodal character, with visual responsiveness tending to peak once a day. We conclude that the ClkJrk mutation mainly affects 1 of 2 functionally coupled oscillators and that the visual system is partially separated from the locomotor circadian circuits that drive bouts of morning and evening activity. As light exposure is a major mechanism for entrainment, our work suggests that a detailed temporal analysis of electrophysiological responses is warranted to better identify the time window at which circadian rhythms are most receptive to light-induced phase shifting.},

	abstract = {We measured neural responses to local and global aspects of form and motion stimuli using frequency-tagged, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Random dot stimuli were used to portray either dynamic Glass patterns (Glass, 1969) or coherent motion displays. SSVEPs were used to estimate neural activity in a set of fMRI-defined visual areas in each subject. To compare activity associated with local versus global processing, we analyzed two frequency components of the SSVEP in each visual area: the high temporal frequency at which the local dots were updated (30 Hz) and the much lower frequency corresponding to updates in the global structure (0.83 Hz). Local and global responses were evaluated in the context of two different behavioral tasks--subjects had to either direct their attention toward or away from the global coherence of the stimuli. The data show that the effect of attention on global and local responses is both stimulus and visual area dependent. When attention was directed away from stimulus coherence, both local and global responses were higher in the coherent motion than Glass pattern condition. Directing attention to coherence in Glass patterns enhanced global activity in areas LOC, hMT+, V4, V3a, and V1, while attention to global motion modulated responses by a smaller amount in a smaller set of areas: V4, hMT+, and LOC. In contrast, directing attention towards stimulus coherence weakly increased local responses to both coherent motion and Glass patterns. These results suggest that visual attention differentially modulates the activity of early visual areas at both local and global levels of structural encoding.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been revolutionized by the discovery of disease-causing genetic mutations. The most common of these is the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 kinase gene, which leads to increased kinase activity. However, the link between increased kinase activity and PD is unclear. Previously, we showed that dopaminergic expression of the human LRRK2-G2019S transgene in flies led to an activity-dependent loss of vision in older animals and we hypothesized that this may have been preceded by a failure to regulate neuronal activity correctly in younger animals. To test this hypothesis, we used a sensitive measure of visual function based on frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked potentials. Spectral analysis allowed us to identify signals from multiple levels of the fly visual system and wild-type visual response curves were qualitatively similar to those from human cortex. Dopaminergic expression of hLRRK2-G2019S increased contrast sensitivity throughout the retinal network. To test whether this was due to increased kinase activity, we fed Drosophila with kinase inhibitors targeted at LRRK2. Contrast sensitivity in both day 1 and day 14 flies was normalized by a novel LRRK2 kinase inhibitor 'BMPPB-32'. Biochemical and cellular assays suggested that BMPPB-32 would be a more specific kinase inhibitor than LRRK2-IN-1. We confirmed this in vivo, finding that dLRRK(-) null flies show large off-target effects with LRRK2-IN-1 but not BMPPB-32. Our data link the increased Kinase activity of the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation to neuronal dysfunction and demonstrate the power of the Drosophila visual system in assaying the neurological effects of genetic diseases and therapies.},

The ROIs included areas V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+, and lateral occipital cortex. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli in each eye modulated at distinct temporal frequencies allowed us to quantify spectral components associated with the individual stimuli from monocular inputs (self-terms) and responses due to interaction between the inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation [IM] terms). Data with self-terms revealed an interocular suppression effect, in which the responses to the stimulus in one eye were reduced when a stimulus was presented simultaneously to the other eye. The suppression magnitude varied depending on visual area, and the relative contrast between the two eyes. Suppression was strongest in V1 and V3a (50\% reduction) and was least in lateral occipital cortex (20\% reduction). Data with IM terms revealed another form of binocular interaction, compared with self-terms. IM response was strongest at V1 and was least in hV4. Fits of a family of divisive gain control models to both self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area indicated that both forms of binocular interaction shared a common gain control nonlinearity.

	abstract = {Vernier acuity determines the relative position of visual features with a precision better than the sampling resolution of cone receptors in the retina. Because Vernier displacement is thought to be mediated by orientation-tuned mechanisms, Vernier acuity is presumed to be processed in striate visual cortex (V1). However, there is considerable evidence suggesting that Vernier acuity is dependent not only on structures in V1 but also on processing in extrastriate cortical regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging-informed electroencephalogram source imaging to localize the cortical sources of Vernier acuity in observers with normal vision. We measured suprathreshold and near-threshold responses to Vernier onset/offset stimuli at different stages of the visual cortical hierarchy, including V1, hV4, lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and middle temporal cortex (hMT+). These responses were compared with responses to grating on/off stimuli, as well as to stimuli that control for lateral motion in the Vernier task. Our results show that all visual cortical regions of interest (ROIs) responded to both suprathreshold Vernier and grating stimuli. However, thresholds for Vernier displacement (Vernier acuity) were lowest in V1 and LOC compared with hV4 and hMT+, whereas all visual ROIs had identical thresholds for spatial frequency (grating acuity) and for relative motion. The cortical selectivity of sensitivity to Vernier displacement provides strong evidence that LOC, in addition to V1, is involved in Vernier acuity processing. The robust activation of LOC might be related to the sensitivity to the relative position of features, which is common to Vernier displacement and to some kinds of texture segmentation.},

	abstract = {Behavioral studies have reported reduced spatial attention in amblyopia, a developmental disorder of spatial vision. However, the neural populations in the visual cortex linked with these behavioral spatial attention deficits have not been identified. Here, we use functional MRI-informed electroencephalography source imaging to measure the effect of attention on neural population activity in the visual cortex of human adult strabismic amblyopes who were stereoblind. We show that compared with controls, the modulatory effects of selective visual attention on the input from the amblyopic eye are substantially reduced in the primary visual cortex (V1) as well as in extrastriate visual areas hV4 and hMT+. Degraded attentional modulation is also found in the normal-acuity fellow eye in areas hV4 and hMT+ but not in V1. These results provide electrophysiological evidence that abnormal binocular input during a developmental critical period may impact cortical connections between the visual cortex and higher level cortices beyond the known amblyopic losses in V1 and V2, suggesting that a deficit of attentional modulation in the visual cortex is an important component of the functional impairment in amblyopia. Furthermore, we find that degraded attentional modulation in V1 is correlated with the magnitude of interocular suppression and the depth of amblyopia. These results support the view that the visual suppression often seen in strabismic amblyopia might be a form of attentional neglect of the visual input to the amblyopic eye.},

@article{Verghese2012,
	abstract = {In a neural population driven by a simple grating stimulus, different subpopulations are maximally informative about changes to the grating's orientation and contrast. In theory, observers should attend to the optimal subpopulation when switching between orientation and contrast discrimination tasks. Here we used source-imaged, steady-state visual evoked potentials and visual psychophysics to determine whether this is the case. Observers fixated centrally while static targets were presented bilaterally along with a cue indicating task type (contrast or orientation modulation detection) and task location (left or right). Changes in neuronal activity were measured by quantifying frequency-tagged responses from flickering "reporter" gratings surrounding the targets. To determine the orientation tuning of attentionally modulated neurons, we measured responses for three different probe-reporter angles: 0, 20, and 45$\,^{\circ}$. We estimated frequency-tagged cortical activity using a minimum norm inverse procedure combined with realistic MR-derived head models and retinotopically mapped visual areas. Estimates of neural activity from regions of interest centered on V1 showed that attention to a spatial location clearly increased the amplitude of the neural response in that location. More importantly, the pattern of modulation depended on the task. For orientation discrimination, attentional modulation showed a sharp peak in the population tuned 20$\,^{\circ}$ from the target orientation, whereas for contrast discrimination the enhancement was more broadly tuned. Similar tuning functions for orientation and contrast discrimination were obtained from psychophysical adaptation studies. These findings indicate that humans attend selectively to the most informative neural population and that these populations change depending on the nature of the task.},

	abstract = {The reliability of visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements of acuity was determined by estimating acuity for sinewave luminance gratings which were counterphase modulated at either 12 or 20 reversals/sec (rps). Gratings were swept in spatial frequency beyond the acuity limit and acuity was estimated from an extrapolation based on the last peak in the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function. Twenty-five infants ranging in age from 17 to 25 weeks were studied. Individual 10 sec sweeps resulted in records with a criterion response in 65-75\% of trials. The reliability of acuities obtained from individual 10 sec sweeps was +/- 0.54 octaves at 95\% confidence across 12 and 20 rps recording conditions (RMS error of +/- 0.27 octaves). The best acuity attained by each infant on either a single sweep, or on their vector average, was reliable to +/- 0.38 octaves at 95\% confidence (RMS error of +/- 0.19 octaves) compared to a range of individual acuities of about 2 octaves. Much of the variability of sweep VEP acuity in cross-sectional samples of infants is therefore attributable to reliable individual differences rather than to measurement error. In testing individual infants our analysis indicates that choice of temporal frequency accounts for only 14\% of the variation in acuity estimates within subjects.},

The gratings were presented as a 10 sec spatial frequency sweep which spanned the acuity limit. The amplitude and phase of the second harmonic response were extracted by discrete Fourier analysis. The VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function showed narrow spatial frequency tuning with amplitude peaks at one or more spatial frequencies. The phase of the response at medium to high spatial frequencies was generally constant at a spatial frequency peak, followed by a progressive phase lag with increasing spatial frequency. Grating acuity was estimated by linear extrapolation to zero microvolts of the highest spatial frequency peak in the VEP amplitude versus spatial frequency function. This visual acuity estimate increased from a mean of 4.5 c/deg during the first month to about 20 c/deg at 8-13 months of age. The VEP acuities at 1 month are a factor of three to five higher than previously reported for pattern reversal or pattern appearance stimuli.

Sweeping spatial frequency linearly and extrapolating the high-frequency region of the VEP spatial-tuning function to zero voltage allows an estimate of acuity which correlates highly with psychophysical estimates of acuity. Variants of the procedure are appropriate for the assessment of refracture error, determination of equality of visual function for the two eyes and of binocular interactions, and for sequential assessment of therapeutic conditions.},

(2) The SSVEP can also show narrow temporal frequency tuning, as narrow as 0.5 octave at half height. (3) Contrast functions relating VEP amplitude to log contrast were highly nonlinear.

	abstract = {1. We evaluated human visual cortical contrast gain using visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements. The steady-state VEP was elicited by 7.5 Hz contrast modulation of a 6 cycles/deg sinusoidal grating. The stimulus may be regarded as the sum of a steady grating (C) and a counterphase grating of the same spatial frequency (delta C). The counterphase grating is modulated sinusoidally in time. 2. The VEP was measured to combinations of different modulation contrasts (delta C) and different mean levels of grating contrast (C) which produced stimuli with contrast modulation depths (delta C/C) ranging from 0.0625 to 1.0 ('on-off'). 3. The VEP signals were Fourier analysed and the amplitude and phase of the first (7.5 Hz) and second (15 Hz) harmonic frequency components were examined. The monocular VEP to a contrast-modulated grating contains significant first and second harmonic frequency components. 4. The amplitude and phase of the monocular VEP was plotted as a function of delta C for each mean level of contrast explored. The amplitudes of both the first and second harmonic frequency components grow with increasing delta C. However, the slope of each function depends on the mean contrast (C): with higher levels of C, the slope of the function is more shallow. Furthermore, at each level of C the amplitude of the first harmonic frequency saturates at a lower delta C than does the second harmonic frequency component. VEP amplitude is therefore not determined by the absolute contrast change (delta C) alone. The VEP phase of the first harmonic frequency shows less dependence on either modulation or on mean contrast; the phase of the second harmonic frequency component is strongly dependent on mean contrast (C) but not on delta C. 5. When the second harmonic amplitude component of the VEP response (R) is expressed as Ractual/Rmax, where Rmax is the response to C = delta C (i.e. 'on-off'), all second harmonic VEP functions can be well fitted with a power function. This is not the case for the function of the first harmonic amplitude data. 6. A dichoptic VEP was obtained by presenting the steady and counterphase gratings to opposite eyes. The dichoptic VEP, in distinction to the monocular VEP, contains only a second harmonic frequency component. The amplitude of the second harmonic frequency component grows with increasing delta C, similar to the function seen for the monocular VEP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Exposure to oriented luminance contrast patterns causes a reduction in visual sensitivity specifically for the adapter orientation. This orientation selectivity is probably the most studied aspect of contrast adaptation, but it has rarely been measured with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), despite their becoming one of the more popular methods of human neuroscience. Here, we measured orientation selective adaptation by presenting a plaid stimulus of which the horizontal and vertical grating reversed contrast at different temporal frequencies, while recording EEG signals from occipital visual areas. In three experiments, we compared SSVEP responses to the plaid before and after adaptation. All experiments showed a significant decrease in SSVEP response at the frequency of the adapter orientation, whereas such an effect was absent for the frequency of the orthogonal orientation. Adaptation also led to robust phase delays, selectively for the SSVEP frequency corresponding to the adapter orientation. These results demonstrate the efficiency of SSVEPs for measuring orientation selective adaptation; the method can measure changes in both amplitude and phase, simultaneously for two orientations.},

@article{Rideaux2023,
	abstract = {A canonical feature of sensory systems is that they adapt to prolonged or repeated inputs, suggesting the brain encodes the temporal context in which stimuli are embedded. Sensory adaptation has been observed in the central nervous systems of many animal species, using techniques sensitive to a broad range of spatiotemporal scales of neural activity. Two competing models have been proposed to account for the phenomenon. One assumes that adaptation reflects reduced neuronal sensitivity to sensory inputs over time (the ``fatigue'' account); the other posits that adaptation arises due to increased neuronal selectivity (the ``sharpening'' account). To adjudicate between these accounts, we exploited the well-known ``tilt aftereffect'', which reflects adaptation to orientation information in visual stimuli. We recorded whole-brain activity with millisecond precision from human observers as they viewed oriented gratings before and after adaptation, and used inverted encoding modeling to characterize feature-specific neural responses. We found that both fatigue and sharpening mechanisms contribute to the tilt aftereffect, but that they operate at different points in the sensory processing cascade to produce qualitatively distinct outcomes. Specifically, fatigue operates during the initial stages of processing, consistent with tonic inhibition of feedforward responses, whereas sharpening occurs {\textasciitilde}200 ms later, consistent with feedback or local recurrent activity.

	abstract = {Human infants can discriminate the orientation of lines within the first week after birth (Atkinson et al., 1988; Slater et al., 1988) but have immature orientation-selective pattern masking until after 6 months of age (Morrone and Burr, 1986). Here the development of orientation processing is further examined using a visual-evoked potential paradigm and normalization models of pattern masking. Contrast response functions were measured for 1 cycle per degree (cpd) gratings, counterphase-reversed in contrast at either 3.3 or 5.5 Hz. A second 1 cpd, 20\% contrast, 8.3 Hz grating of either the same or orthogonal orientation was added as a mask. Evoked responses associated with the test grating, the mask, and intermodulation between the two were individually extracted using spectral analysis of the scalp-recorded EEG. Adults exhibited orientation selectivity in the masking of their test component responses and in nonlinear intermodulation between the test and mask stimuli. Infants {\textless}5 months old, however, demonstrated nonselective masking or a reversed selectivity in their responses to the test component, with adult-like orientation selectivity in their intermodulation responses. Within the context of a normalization model of pattern masking, the results are consistent with the existence of oriented filters early in life the responses of which are normalized immaturely until approximately 5 months of age.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The origin of neural hyperexcitability underlying idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is not known. The objective of this study is to identify evidence of hyperexcitability in precisely measured visual evoked responses and to understand the nature of changes in excitation and inhibition that lead to altered responses in human patients with IGE.
METHODS: Steady-state visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to contrast reversing gratings were recorded over a wide range of stimulus contrast. VEPs were analyzed at the pattern reversal rate using spectral analysis. Ten patients with IGE and 13 healthy subjects participated. All subjects had normal visual acuity and had no history of photic-induced seizures or photoparoxysmal electroencephalograph (EEG) activity.
RESULTS: At a group level, the amplitude of visual responses did not saturate at high stimulus contrast in patients, as it did in the control subjects. This reflects an abnormality in neuronal gain control. The VEPs did not have sufficient power to reliably distinguish patients from controls at an individual level. Parametric modeling using a standard gain control framework showed that the abnormality lay in reduced inhibition from neighboring neurons rather than increased excitatory response to the stimulus.
INTERPRETATION: Visual evoked responses reveal changes in a fundamental mechanism regulating neuronal sensitivity. These changes may give rise to hyperexcitability underlying generalized epilepsy.},

@article{Tsai2012,
	abstract = {Stimulus visibility can be reduced by other stimuli that overlap the same region of visual space, a process known as masking. Here we studied the neural mechanisms of masking in humans using source-imaged steady state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis over a wide range of relative stimulus strengths of test and mask stimuli. Test and mask stimuli were tagged with distinct temporal frequencies and we quantified spectral response components associated with the individual stimuli (self terms) and responses due to interaction between stimuli (intermodulation terms). In early visual cortex, masking alters the self terms in a manner consistent with a reduction of input contrast. We also identify a novel signature of masking: a robust intermodulation term that peaks when the test and mask stimuli have equal contrast and disappears when they are widely different. We fit all of our data simultaneously with family of a divisive gain control models that differed only in their dynamics. Models with either very short or very long temporal integration constants for the gain pool performed worse than a model with an integration time of ∼30 ms. Finally, the absolute magnitudes of the response were controlled by the ratio of the stimulus contrasts, not their absolute values. This contrast-contrast invariance suggests that many neurons in early visual cortex code relative rather than absolute contrast. Together, these results provide a more complete description of masking within the normalization framework of contrast gain control and suggest that contrast normalization accomplishes multiple functional goals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Visual hyperexcitability in the form of abnormal contrast gain control has been shown in photosensitive epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsies. We assessed the accuracy and reliability of measures of visual contrast gain control in discerning individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsies from healthy controls.
METHODS: Twenty-four adult patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and 32 neurotypical control subjects from two study sites participated in a prospective, cross-sectional study. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials to a wide range of contrasts of a flickering grating stimulus. The resultant response magnitude vs. contrast curves were fitted to a standard model of contrast response function, and the model parameters were used as input features to a linear classifier to separate patients from controls. Additionally we compared the relative contribution of model parameters towards the classification using a sparse feature-selection approach.
RESULTS: Classification accuracy was 80\% or better. Sensitivity and specificity both were 80-85\%. Cross validation confirmed robust classifier performance generalizable across the data from the two samples. Patients' relative lack of gain control at high contrasts was the most important information distinguishing patients from controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy were distinguishable from the neurotypical with a high degree of accuracy and reliability by a reduction in gain control at high contrasts.
SIGNIFICANCE: Gain control is an essential neural operation that regulates neuronal sensitivity to stimuli and may represent a novel biomarker of hyperexcitability.},

To better understand the triggering elements of visual stimuli and cortical mechanisms of hyperexcitability, we examined eleven patients with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy by recording visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to temporally modulated patterns of different contrast. For stimuli of low-medium, but not high, temporal frequency, the contrast dependence of VEP amplitude and latency is remarkably abnormal for luminance contrast (black-white), but not so for chromatic contrast (equiluminant red-green) stimuli. We conclude that cortical mechanisms of contrast gain control for pattern stimuli of relatively low temporal frequency and high luminance contrast are lacking or severely impaired in photosensitive subjects.},

VEP phase was almost constant as function of spatial frequency (2--30 c/deg, 6.5 r/sec, 51 subjects). The phase function however shows a small phase increase at low spatial frequencies consistent with the existence of multiple temporal mechanisms. Contrast variation yields a smaller phase increase with decreasing contrast than conventional stimulation. The phase is linear as function of reversal rate (2--31 r/sec) for low and high spatial frequencies. The indication of more than one temporal mechanism has also been found when the test field diameter was varied. With decreasing test field size the phase increases at 6.5 r/sec, but decreases at 18 r/sec (for 12 c/deg).},

	abstract = {1. A model is proposed for the effect of contrast on the first-order frequency responses of cat retinal ganglion cells. The model consists of several cascaded low pass filters ('leaky integrators') followed by a single stage of negative feed-back. 2. Values of time constants and gain of the components in this model were chosen to approximate (with least-squared deviation) experimentally measured first-order frequency responses. In the experiments used for the analysis, the visual stimulus was a sine grating modulated by a sum of sinusoids. 3. For both X cells and Y cells, the over-all gain and the time constants of the cascade of low pass filters were insensitive to contrast. 4. In all cells, the gain-bandwidth product of the negative feed-back loop was markedly increased with increasing contrast. 5. The effect of stimulation in the periphery of the receptive fields on the first-order frequency response to a centrally placed spot was identical to the effect of increasing contrast in the grating experiments. In all cases, the gain-bandwidth product of the negative feed-back loop was the only model parameter affected by peripheral stimulation. 6. A similar effect of non-linear summation was investigated for two bars located in the receptive field periphery. 7. This analysis of the contrast gain control mechanism is compared with other models of retinal function.},

No spatial contrast component could be demonstrated in the ERG. Contrast EP's depend on various parameters such as acuity, retinal location, size and configuration of spatial elements, time course of luminance change. They are affected by overlapping steady contrasts presented either monocularly or dichoptically. For a given condition the contrast EP is mainly determined by the instantaneous relative contrast irrespective whether this contrast is reached by an increase or decrease in luminance. The EP's to the appearance and disappearance of a pattern bear different relations to stimulus parameters and seem to originate from different populations of cortical cells. The responses to short appearances obey the contrast equivalent of Bloch's law and correlate with psychophysics.

Unter gegebenen Bedingungen wird das Kontrast-EP haupts{\"a}chlich durch den momentanen relativen Kontrast bestimmt, gleichg{\"u}ltig ob dieser Kontrast durch eine Zunahme oder Abnahme der Leuchtdichte erhalten wird. Die EP-s bei Erscheinen und Verschwinden eines Musters h{\"a}ngen in unterschiedlicher Weise von den Reizparametern ab und scheinen aus verschiedenen kortikalen Zellen zu kommen.

The object-defining system needs to operate in the real world, where objects and viewers move, and where the scene is cluttered, rarely offering a clear, unobscured view of any object. How are we able to see and define objects using the complex pattern of light falling on the retina? An object becomes visible if it differs sufficiently from its surroundings in its luminance, color, texture, motion, or depth. Although the processes that use these different cues are quite distinct, research has shown that they share some organizational principles. This book, Seeing Spatial Form, is dedicated to David Martin Regan who has made so many contributions to our understanding of how we see objects. Its chapters bring together ideas from some of the world's leading researchers in form vision to explain what we know about distinguishing form. The book includes a CD-ROM, which contains additional demonstrations and color images that considerably enhance the chapter contents. Seeing Spatial Form will be an invaluable resource for student and professional researchers in vision science, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience.},

@article{Huang2022,
	abstract = {Sensory atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to arise at least partly from differences in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor function. However, the evidence to date has been indirect, arising from correlational studies in patients and preclinical models. Here, we evaluated the role of GABA receptor directly, in 44 adults (n = 19 ASD). Baseline concentration of occipital lobe GABA+ (GABA plus coedited macromolecules) was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) elicited by a passive visual surround suppression paradigm was compared after double-blind randomized oral administration of placebo or 15 to 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABAB) receptor agonist. In the placebo condition, the neurotypical SSVEP response was affected by both the foreground stimuli contrast and background interference (suppression). In ASD, however, all stimuli conditions had equal salience and background suppression of the foreground response was weaker. In the placebo condition, although there was no difference in GABA+ between groups, GABA+ concentration positively correlated with response to maximum foreground contrast during maximum background interference in neurotypicals, but not ASD. In neurotypicals, sensitivity to visual stimuli was disrupted by 30 mg of arbaclofen, whereas in ASD, it was made more ``typical'' and visual processing differences were abolished. Hence, differences in GABAergic function are fundamental to autistic (visual) sensory neurobiology and are modulated by GABAB activity.},
