Repository for the Wade/Baker SSVEP review paper, Visual Neuroscience

This is an 'executable paper' written in the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) framework. For more details on how to set up and compile these documents see the Quarto website.

Critical files are 

* The paper itself : review.qmd
* The biliographic references (in bibtex format) : WadeBaker_Review.bib
* visual-neuroscience.csl : Formatting for the journal
* Rversion (a folder containing a version of the paper using R instead of Python).

If you use conda/mamba you should be able to set up a suitable environment using the environment_quarto.yml file
We have also included a pip-friendly requirements.txt file which will get you most of the way there.

The code in the paper can be edited. Alternatively you can simply break it out into a separate file and run it there to save you having to re-compile the whole Quarto doc.
